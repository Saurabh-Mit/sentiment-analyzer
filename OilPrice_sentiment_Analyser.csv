Oil Market Still Far From Being Back To Normal.html,"Worry about oil demand sparked by the resurgence of Covid-19 in some parts of the world and a fund selloff in oil futures has reversed the recent price rally. OPEC+ reaching a deal about future production lent an assist. New Covid-19 infections are on the rise across all 50 states, and there have been jumps in new cases in some European countries as well, notably the UK and France. In the UK, the latest wave is ebbing, according to the latest reports, but optimism is in short supply as it is still unclear why it is ebbing. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates struck a deal about production baselines, so OPEC+ is moving ahead with its plans to release more oil to the market, pressuring prices. Last week, Reuters’ John Kemp reported in his weekly column, hedge funds and other market makers sold oil and fuel futures at one of the fastest rates in ten years. The total sold was equivalent to 172 million barrels of crude. The most sold contract was West Texas Intermediate, at 74 million barrels, followed by Brent crude, at 51 million barrels. But besides OPEC+ and new Covid-19 infections, there is also another reason worrying oil traders about the immediate prospects for prices. China is targeting independent refiners with the aim of curbing their output, which is causing a glut.
  Earlier this year, the government told state-owned oil majors to stop trading their crude oil import quotas with independents, commonly called teapots, and then, later, it cut the second 2021 batch of crude oil import quotas for teapots by 35 percent. Beijing is also investigating independent refiners for environmental law violations and tax evasion. This crackdown in independent refiners, combined with higher oil prices, could plunge Chinese oil imports to the lowest in 20 years, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing analysts from Rystad Energy, Energy Aspects, and Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. For now, however, imports continue at a near-record pace. “There is seemingly a battle within the energy complex between the prevailing supply deficit engineered by OPEC+ and the threat of the COVID-19 Delta variant in regions with low vaccination rates,” Reuters quoted Stone X analyst Kevin Solomon as saying this week. “The slow take-up of vaccinations will continue to limit some upside in oil demand in those regions, and there will be intermittent spells in the recovery in the coming months,” Solomon also said.
 Indeed, oil has yet to come out of the woods. According to Societe Generale, “We think we could be back to a ‘normal’ year at the end of the year in terms of previously recorded values, but the entire oil market is still far from being back to normal. GDP growth has increased oil and product demand, but jet fuel demand will remain an issue although this is showing signs of normalisation.” And yet it bears noting that although both Brent and WTI took a plunge the day after OPEC+ announced its new agreement, both recovered pretty quickly, suggesting that there exists at least some perception of some resilience in demand, despite the rising Covid-19 case count in key markets such as the United States and parts of Europe. In the United States, for example, there has been a surge in air travel, which has caused a jet fuel shortage in combination with supply constraints and a labor shortage. In China, refinery run rates hit an all-time high last month, at 14.8 million bpd, supporting prices at current levels. All in all, the oil picture right now is more mixed than it was a month ago. Whether it would become even more mixed is anyone’s guess amid uneven vaccinations, vaccine opposition, and new Covid-19 infections, without even counting factors such as Iran’s potential return on international oil markets, which by now must be factored into prices.",Negative
Is Americas Oil Industry Too Big To Fail.html,"The Biden administration is making strides in reducing the United States’ dependence on fossil fuels for its energy needs. The federal government’s post-pandemic plan involves hundreds of billions in financing for renewable energy and electric vehicle projects. But it might be harder to get rid of oil and gas than some would like to believe. In a recent report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute, PwC described the oil and gas industry as a critical one for the United States in terms of both direct and indirect impacts in the form of employment, labor income, and value added. The report makes for quite interesting and sobering reading. For example, the oil and gas industry employed 11.3 million Americans in 2019, both directly and indirectly. Labor income from these jobs, which PwC defines as wages and salaries, and benefits as well as proprietors’ income, came in at $892.7 billion for that same year. Finally, the value added by the oil and gas industry in the U.S. for 2019 came in at about $1.688 trillion. In other words, the oil and gas industry contributed close to $1.688 trillion to the national GDP. PwC noted that each direct job in the oil and gas industry supported another 3.5 in other industries. And that is counting only so-called backward linkages, as the authors of the report point out. Backward linkages refer to those with the industry’s suppliers. Forward linkages, which were not included in the calculation of the impact of oil and gas on the U.S. economy, refer to those with the industry’s consumers. Related: Top Oilfield Service Providers See Multi-Year Recovery Ahead Now, the pandemic last year wrought havoc on the oil and gas industry, but it didn’t kill it—it is far too big to kill, if you will. This year, it is in recovery mode, and even production has been growing consistently, albeit cautiously. Yet green transition plans envisage a much smaller role for oil and gas for the U.S. economy. What will replace it? The obvious answer would be “Renewable energy”. Yet wind and solar farm construction is very different from oil and gas production. Let’s talk about employment as it would be the simplest example. Oil wells are drilled and then monitored and maintained. Solar farms, once built, need a lot less maintenance and monitoring than an oil well—after all, that’s one of the best things about solar; the panels just sit there soaking the sun’s heat, turning it into electricity. Oil and gas, meanwhile, need someone watching them flow out from the ground properly.
 What this means is that oil and gas production needs more people than solar farm operations. And what this means is that oil and gas production creates more jobs than solar farm construction could, on a permanent basis. On the one hand, this makes oil and gas an uneconomical industry. On the other, it creates jobs, and job creation is good for the economy. And what about those $1.688 trillion that oil and gas production, transport, storage, and property generated for the U.S. economy? Some $1.4 trillion of this total came from direct and indirect operations, PwC said. Capital investments by the industry added another $245.4 billion. The total amount accounted for 7.9 percent of U.S. GDP for 2019.  Related: Can The Airline Industry Live Without Fossil Fuels? Here are some of the industries that oil and gas impacted indirectly with regard to GDP generation: the service sector was by far the most heavily impacted, followed by finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing. Wholesale and retail trade was also considerably affected by oil and gas, as were manufacturing, transportation, and warehousing, and information, although to a lesser extent. The total indirect impact of oil and gas on these industries came in at $924.3 billion, in both operational and capital investment impacts. Now let’s consider renewables and their impact on job creation and GDP. A 2016 report by the International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that “Given the distributed and labor-intensive nature of renewable energy, direct and indirect employment in the renewable energy sector could reach 24.4 million people in 2030.” That’s 24.4 million people globally. Also, the IRENA estimated that “Doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix increases global GDP in 2030 by up to 1.1%, equivalent to USD 1.3 trillion.” That’s compared with $1.688 trillion in GDP contributions from oil and gas in the U.S. alone in 2019.
 In a more recent report, from last year, IRENA estimates that the total number of energy sector jobs globally will increase to almost 100 million under an energy transition scenario the agency called ambitious yet realistic that would allow the world to achieve its goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. That’s almost a doubling of the 58 million employed in energy in 2017. As to what these renewable-energy jobs would be, IRENA is scarce on the details, mentioning renewable energy and energy efficiency as some job avenues in its scenario. At the same time, the agency forecasts a 40-percent decline in fossil fuel jobs in North America, as well as Europe. IRENA mentions the effects of the energy transition on GDP, too, noting these would be mostly positive, but they would depend on differences in the “socio-economic starting point.” Yet for North America, the agency sees GDP gains from the transition, to the tune of $659 per capita per year. From IRENA’s perspective, this outweighs any economic benefits the oil and gas industry in any country could provide because these go hand in hand with emissions. However, the U.S. government data cited in the PwC report suggests that emissions or not, the contributions of oil and gas might be difficult to let go of.",Positive
Total Equinor To Quit Venezuela Venture.html,"French TotalEnergies and Norwegian Equinor will exit their oil joint venture with PDVSA, Bloomberg has reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. TotalEnergies held a 30-percent stake in the Petrocedeno venture, and Equinor held 10 percent in the company. But now, both have transferred these stakes to the Venezuelan state-owned oil firm, according to the Bloomberg sources. The report said the news was expected to be confirmed by the Venezuelan government on Wednesday, but as of the time of writing, there was no official confirmation. Petrocedeno operates an oil field in Venezuela’s oil heartland, the Orinoco Belt, and an upgrader that blends the heavy crude produced in the Orinoco Belt with lighter hydrocarbons to make it easier to transport.
 Both TotalEnergies and Equinor have been present in Venezuela for decades. The companies stuck to Petrocedeno despite U.S. sanctions. Now, however, both companies are embarking on a course towards more renewable energy and less oil and gas, and, like others in the industry, focusing only on their best core business assets. Venezuela, meanwhile, continues to make plans for reviving its struggling oil industry, targeting oil production of 1.5 million bpd by the end of this year. This would be a threefold increase over current production rates. Before the U.S. imposed sanctions on the oil-rich country, Venezuela pumped some 2.4 million bpd. Last month, troubled PDVSA enjoyed a surge in oil exports as well, as traders rushed to sell Venezuelan crude—often masked as Malaysian—to Chinese buyers before the entry into effect of a new tax that would make imports costlier.
 Production of crude in Venezuela also increased in June, thanks to the restart of the Petrocedeno upgrader and a blending plant. “Without any financing, with our own money, we’ve been able to invest enough to stop the slide and start a gradual recovery,” oil minister Tareck El Aissami said in early July.",Positive
Oil Tops 75 On Shrinking US Crude Inventories.html,"Brent crude futures topped $75 on Thursday morning as U.S. crude oil inventories fell to 7 percent below the five-year average, according to EIA data. The September Brent crude futures contract rose 0.59% to $75.18 per barrel on Thursday at 10:30 p.m., EDT. The WTI benchmark, for its part, landed at $72.82 per barrel, up $0.44, or 0.59% on the day. The rise in crude oil prices comes despite oil demand concerns on the back of mounting fears regarding Covid-19’s Delta variant and disappointing news of waning efficacy of the Pfizer jab after six months.
 The decreasing inventories and steady-as-she-goes U.S. oil production is assuaging the fears that production increases will outpace demand increases. On the contrary, U.S. oil production has failed to make any meaningful gains over the last seven months. In December, oil production averaged roughly 11 million bpd, while July’s production has come within 200,000-400,000 bpd of that figure. Meanwhile, oil inventories have continued to draw down during that time, shedding between 55 million and 68 million barrels total, depending on whether API or EIA data is used. The data inspires confidence. Not necessarily that oil demand is roaring back, but that it is outpacing U.S. production. But that’s not to say that sunny days are here to stay.
 Fluid Covid-19 developments, a possible uptick in oil supplies from Iran and Venezuela as sanctions are potentially reconsidered, and OPEC’s production plans all have a strong pull on oil prices. Inventory and rig data, particularly in the United States, will continue to have a powerful effect on the markets. All eyes now will be on Friday’s rig count provided by Baker Hughes as well as Primary Vision’s Frac Spread count. When combined, the two data sets can give a look ahead at future U.S. oil production and the overall sentiment presiding over the U.S. oil industry.",Positive
Why Norway Wont Give Up On Oil Gas.html,,Neutral
Shrinking Global Populations Poses An Existential Threat To Oil.html,"About a week ago, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman made waves in the oil community after telling Bloomberg News that Saudi Arabia ""...is going to be the last man standing, and every molecule of hydrocarbon will come out."" The comments by bin Salman—heralded as the most powerful man in the global oil and gas industry—came shortly after the latest OPEC+ agreement and mirrored those by Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, who expressed similar sentiments back in January 2019. And this might not be idle bluster: In late 2019, Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and markets division at the International Energy Agency, told CNBC that, ""There's going to be rising demand for at least the next decade for oil products, possibly longer, and this is cementing [Saudi Arabia's] role as the cornerstone player in global markets, the most reliable and biggest supplier in markets.""  Atkinson also highlighted another rarely discussed oil demand headwind: Shrinking populations in key demand locations. According to Atkinson, population growth remains the key driving force for oil demand, which he estimated could peak in the 2030s. 'Jaw-Dropping' Population Declines  Source: BBC Over the past few years, most of the energy community's attention has been focused on seemingly more existential crises such as climate change. Now, the focus is on the Covid-19 pandemic. But seldom is population decline mentioned as a major headwind for the long-term oil demand outlook. Maybe that's the case because, unlike the other two risk factors, population decline really is a success story being driven by more women in education and work, as well as greater access to contraception, leading to women choosing to have fewer children. Another reason is because population decline is a much slower process whose full effects could take decades to be felt.  But make no mistake about it: Experts are now warning that the world's population is declining at faster than anticipated rates, which could end up having a dramatic effect on major sectors of the global economy, including energy. In early July, Researchers at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation warned that declining and aging populations are no longer a problem for developed economies but, rather, most of the world is currently transitioning into natural population decline.
 In 1950, women were having an average of 4.7 children in their lifetime; the fertility rate nearly halved to 2.4 in 2017 and is projected to fall below 1.7 by 2100. That's well below the 2.1 children per woman that's considered the replacement level for developed nations, meaning the global population will be experiencing massive contraction by the turn of the century. Indeed, the researchers have projected that the global population will peak at 9.7 billion around 2064 before falling down to 8.8 billion by 2100. Population Declines by Major Oil Consumers What makes the long-term situation murky for the oil and gas bulls is the large population declines expected in major oil and gas consumers. By 2100, China and Japan could see their populations drop by roughly 50%. China is the world's second-largest oil consumer in the world, with a daily consumption estimated at 12.8 million barrels per day, while Japan is the fourth largest with a daily consumption of 4.0 million barrels per day. India, the third-largest oil-consuming nation, will fare a bit better but will still lose a quarter of its population by 2100. Russia, the 5th largest, is projected to see its population drop between 15-50%. The U.S. population is projected to expand from the current 331 million in 2020 to 404 million in 2060, when it's expected to plateau. The Eurozone—a region that consumes as much oil as the United States—is one of the few bright spots. Europe is projected to continue growing its population from 507 million in 2020 to 708 million in 20175 before falling to 689 million by 2100. However, Europe also has also set some of the world's most aggressive climate targets, with the European Union having announced a raft of climate change proposals aimed at pushing it towards its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The problem of falling populations is likely to be aggravated by an aging crisis. The world's number of 80-year-olds is expected to rise from 141 million currently to 866 million by 2100, according to the BBC.
 In the United States, the number of Americans aged 65 or older will jump nearly 75% by 2060 from 56.4 million to 98.2 million. This translates into a demand drop for gasoline of about 5% when looking at 2019 usage statistics and assuming an average of 20 miles per gallon, per driver. Miles driven per year drops dramatically from the 55-64 age bracket (11,972 miles per year) to 7,646 for the 65 and over age bracket.  Aging will also adversely affect the economy, with a 10% increase in the fraction of the population ages 60+ estimated to decrease the growth rate of GDP per capita by 5.5%. The African Situation Rapid population growth in Africa could take up some of that slack but will likely be far from adequate to stem the tide in the developed world. Africa is an interesting case not only due to the fact that demographic forecasts of coming decades diverge in a way that could be crucial but also due to the fact that the continent has a huge population that consumes 4.3 million barrels of oil per day, or slightly less than India.  The UN expects Africa's population to double from 1.3 billion in 2020 to 2.5 billion by 2050 and 4.3 billion people by 2100. The UN reckons that fertility rates in Africa—which have dropped to about 4.4 from 6.7 in 1980—will take another three decades to fall below three children per woman. However, that underestimates the impact of a big jump in the number of girls who are now going to school across large parts of the continent. In the 1970s, little more than half of all children in sub-Saharan Africa were enrolled in primary school, a proportion that has since shot up to almost 100%. Lessons garnered from other parts of the world that have recorded such dramatic increases in enrollment rates suggest that this factor cannot be underestimated in predicting the population growth curve. For instance, Iranian women went from having seven children each to fewer than two between the early 1980s and 2006 after a big rise in female education. Further, although emerging economies have mostly been missing in the ongoing ESG boom, Africa is catching up with the IMF predicting a meaningful shift in African power consumption to renewables by 2050, with most power expected to come from solar and wind by 2100. Overall, we can surmise that population trends across the globe pose a slow yet real and insidious threat to the long-term oil demand outlook even in lieu of increasingly hostile climate policies by the world's governments.",Positive
Exxon Makes Another Major Oil Discovery Offshore Guyana.html,"ExxonMobil and its partner Hess Corporation have made another significant crude oil discovery offshore Guyana, the U.S. supermajor said on Wednesday. The Whiptail discovery in the Stabroek Block adds to more than a dozen discoveries on the block and the previous recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Whiptail, located southeast of Uaru and west of Yellowtail discoveries, could form the basis of another future development in the Stabroek Block, Exxon and Hess said. “Whiptail is a significant new oil discovery that will add to the discovered recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and could underpin a future oil development in the southeast area of the Stabroek Block,” Hess Corporation’s CEO John Hess said in a statement.
 ExxonMobil and Hess believe offshore Guyana could allow for at least six projects online by 2027 and see the potential for up to 10 projects to develop the current recoverable resource base in the waters of the South American country. In less than five years, Exxon and its partners in the Stabroek Block made more than a dozen quality discoveries on the block, making Guyana the newest oil-producing nation in December 2019.      The Liza Phase 1 offshore project—Guyana’s first oil-producing project led by ExxonMobil—has reached its full planned production capacity of some 130,000 barrels per day (bpd), Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali said earlier this year. Liza Phase 1 currently produces 120,000 bpd, Exxon said today.
 The Liza Phase 2 Project is designed to pump up to 220,000 bpd with a floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO), and remains on target for early 2022, Exxon says. Guyana is one of the top priorities in the U.S. supermajor’s strategy to focus on high-return and cash-generating projects that would allow it to grow its dividend through 2025.  ",Negative
Heres Why Analysts Expect Record High Earnings For ExxonMobil.html,"Surging prices for plastics are likely to help Exxon's petrochemicals division post record-high earnings this week when the company reports its earnings. Items like flooring, roofing and packaging all saw demand remain firm throughout the pandemic. This helped keep a bid under the price of the commodity while the ""lockdown trade"" pulled the rug out from under the bid of other items, like vacations and corporate real estate. Chemical ingredients like polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride used to make plastics have seen record-high prices this year. Limited supply and bottlenecked shipping are adding to the price momentum.  Expectations for Exxon's upcoming earnings report are that the company will show ""a radical financial transformation from last year,"" according to Bloomberg this week. With higher oil prices as an obvious tailwind, the supermajor is expected to have generated enough cash to pay its dividend for a second straight quarter, moving away from the habit of borrowing to fund the distribution. Morgan Stanley has even said that the company has its ""best dividend coverage in a decade"".  
 Matt Murphy, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. told Bloomberg: “Chemicals has certainly been a noteworthy area of continued improvement for the majors and Exxon in particular. It’s an area that hasn’t tended to get a ton of focus in the past, but it’s providing strong support for free cash flow across the group.” Bloomberg analysts estimate Exxon's chemicals segment brought in about $1.94 billion in Q2.  Related: Can Iran Avoid A Major National Uprising? Shell and Chevron should also see a rise in profit as a result of the rising prices, Bloomberg notes, but Exxon stands out from the group as the ""biggest winner"" thanks to the large size of its chemicals division. Exxon currently has chemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast, in Rotterdam, and in Singapore. It is currently expanding into Texas and China. 
 Zachary Moore, a market analyst for data provider ICIS, said: “Strong earnings should continue for the remainder of this year. Changes in consumer behavior such as more online shopping and at-home dining may make a permanent jump of around 2-3% in overall demand for polyethylene packaging.” Paul Cheng, an analyst at Scotiabank, added: “This quarter will have gangbuster chemical earnings, but it probably marked the peak and will come off in subsequent quarters.” Cheng attributes his predictions for a peak, followed by a pullback, to supply chains loosening up and facilities recovering from outages.  Earnings are also expected to be helped along by cuts in spending put into place by Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods, who aims to scale back growth spending by $10 billion per year, out to 2025. The cuts have allowed Exxon ""to harvest large cash flows from this year’s higher oil and gas prices,"" the report says.  Exxon is set to report earnings on Friday. In Q1, the company's chemical segment reported its highest profit in almost a decade.",Positive
The Most Important Oil Project Of The Year Is Set To Go Live.html,"Iran’s Jask oil terminal is now fully set to start loading vast quantities of crude to any major buyer in the world via the Gulf of Oman, with the first shipment of 100,000 metric tons of oil set to dock, load, and sail again within days. The significance of this new terminal can barely be overstated, as it will allow Iran to transport oil and petrochemicals from its major oil fields via Guriyeh in the Shoaybiyeh-ye Gharbi Rural District of Khuzestan Province 1,100 kilometers to Jask Port in Hormozgan province. In short, this 42-inch Guriyeh-Jask pipeline and Jask Oil Terminal build-out will allow Iran to circumvent U.S.-led sanctions against it whilst at the same time allowing Tehran the option of disrupting all other oil supplies that travel through the Strait of Hormuz (around 35 percent of the world’s total).  Up until the completion of the huge Jask facility, with sanctions on Iran still in place following the U.S.’s unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018, Tehran has been relying on its tried-and-tested sanctions-busting measures to continue to export increasing volumes of crude oil, especially to China, as exclusively revealed by OilPrice.com. These measures include the re-labeling of Iranian oil into Iraqi oil on the border and at the shared oil reservoirs of the two allies, the use of international brokers to hide Iranian oil movements under the guise of other clients, ship-to-ship transfers of Iranian oil in the territorial waters of Malaysia, Indonesia, and China, and the amalgamation of Iranian oil in Iraq’s oil pipeline export routes.  With the Guriyeh-Jask pipeline and Jask Oil Terminal now in place, though, the volumes of oil that Iran will be able to move freely out to China via the Gulf of Oman, and to other target clients in Asia and elsewhere, will increase dramatically. “Even before U.S. sanctions were re-introduced, the Kharg terminal accounted for around 90 percent of all of Iranian oil export loadings, with the remaining loads going through terminals on Lavan and Sirri, which made obvious and easy targets for the U.S. and its proxies to cripple Iran’s oil sector and therefore its economy,” a senior oil and gas industry source who works closely with Iran’s Petroleum Ministry told OilPrice.com. “In addition, the extreme narrowness of the Strait of Hormuz means that oil tankers have to travel very slowly through it, so pushing up the transit costs and delaying revenue streams,” he said. “Conversely, Iran wants to be able to use the threat – or reality – of closing the Strait of Hormuz for political reasons without also completely destroying its own oil exports revenue stream,” he added.  In the first instance, the oil to be pumped from Guriyeh will be drawn from the cluster of resource-rich oil fields in the West Karoun area, including the supergiant fields of North Azadegan, South Azadegan, North Yaran, South Yaran, and Yadavaran. These fields in particular are the current focus of Iran’s program to increase the mean average rate of recovery from its key oil sites from around 4 percent at present to at least 12 percent within the next two years. According to the Iran source, every incremental barrel increase is being sought as, for every one percent that the rate of recovery from West Karoun is increased the recoverable reserves increase by 670 million barrels. Even with an average Brent crude oil price of US$70 per barrel, this would equate to just under US$50 billion in additional revenues for Iran per each one percent increase.  Related: Top Oilfield Service Providers See Multi-Year Recovery Ahead
 Such an increase in Iran’s rate of recovery is entirely reasonable to project, given that the lifting cost per barrel of crude oil in Iran is at the same world-low level as in Saudi Arabia (US$1-2) – implying the same ease of extraction – and Saudi Arabia’s mean average rate of recovery across its fields is at minimum 50 percent. Saudi, moreover, is looking to increase this to 75 percent within the next couple of years. Back when the JCPOA had just been officially implemented on 16 January 2016, a number of international oil companies presented realistic plans to Iran’s Petroleum Ministry detailing how they could increase the average rate of recovery at the West Karoun fields with relative ease: in the first instance to at least 12.5 percent within one year, to 20 percent within two years, and to 50 percent within five years. Once the oil arrives in Jask, it is stored in any of the 20 storage tanks each capable of storing 500,000 barrels of oil in the first phase (totaling 10 million barrels) for later loading onto very large crude carriers (VLCCs) headed from the Gulf of Oman and into the Arabian Sea and then to the Indian Ocean. The second phase will see an expansion to an overall storage capacity of 30 million barrels. These VLCCs will be accommodated in shipping facilities that have cost around US$200 million in the first phase, although the plans are to expand capacity to allow for further regular shipping of various oil-adjunct and petrochemical products in particular demand in Asia.   In addition, a single point mooring (SPM) loading system with a capacity of 7,000 square meters per hour of loading capacity recently arrived in Assaluyeh, southern Iran, which would also allow for an increase in gas condensate loading capacity at the country’s supergiant non-associated natural gas field South Pars. This SPM will allow for the handling of liquid cargo, such as petroleum products, for tanker ships. “There will be a few more of these installed in the south, in the Gulf of Oman, in the coming months, as they are very useful in areas where a dedicated facility for loading or unloading liquid cargo is not available,” the Iran source told OilPrice.com. These SPMs will operate in a similar manner to those of Iran’s neighbor, Iraq, in that they will be located many kilometers away from the onshore facilities, connected to them by a series of sub-sea pipelines, and able to handle the biggest of VLCCs. 
 Having huge oil storage capacity available just a short direct sea journey away from India means that pressure from India and Pakistan is likely to result in the final go-ahead for the construction of the Iran-Pakistan-China pipeline. “This would necessitate the stationing of Iranian security personnel – that is, IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps] – on Pakistani soil, which is of considerable strategic interest for the IRGC,” said the Iran source. “It also means that Iran can send oil supplies – and anything else it wants in the tankers – to the Houthi faction in Yemen to keep a constant threat to the Saudi southern flank, and also to militia groupings in Somalia and Kenya,” he added. Given the broad and deep ties between Iran and China, these routes and plans perfectly coalesce with Beijing’s own multi-generational power grab project, ‘One Belt, One Road’.  This program, as has been highlighted on numerous occasions – including most recently in the cases on Sri Lanka and Djibouti – uses an initial extension of financing by China to a country in desperate need of funding to allow Beijing to gain a foothold and then when the debtor country cannot afford the repayments on its debt, allows China to grab key assets of the country instead. In Sri Lanka, Beijing began its push by extending unlimited loans to beleaguered former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, for his Hambantota Port Development Project. This project – as the Chinese well knew - stood little chance of succeeding as a port and when it failed to generate any significant business and Rajapaksa was voted out of office, the new government was unable to meet the loan repayment demands. At that point, the new Sri Lankan government had little choice but to hand over the port to China (plus 15,000 other acres of surrounding land) for a period of at least 99 years in restitution. Hambantota may have been useless as a standard port from the money-making perspective, but for China it is of enormous strategic significance, overlooking South Asia’s major sea lanes, and allowing it in the future to establish a dual-use (commercial and military) facility for naval assets. ",Positive
Oil Prices Boosted By Falling Crude Inventories.html,"Crude oil prices rose today after the Energy Information Administration reported an inventory draw of 4.1 million barrels for the week to July 23. This compared with a build of 2.1 million barrels reported for the previous week and a draw of 4.728 million barrels reported by the American Petroleum Institute for the week to July 23. Analysts had expected the EIA to report a crude oil inventory draw of 3.43 million barrels for the week to July 23.
 In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 2.3 million barrels for last week, with production averaging 9.8 million bpd. This compared with a modest stock decline of 100,000 barrels reported for the previous week and average production of 9.1 million bpd. Gasoline demand has recovered strongly this summer, but according to a fresh Reuters report, it is already plateauing amid the resurgence in Covid-19 cases. ""We're still very much actively dealing with new cases here in the U.S. and also abroad, and that is putting greater pull on demand and what was originally anticipated for this recovery process in the middle of the summer for this year,"" said the American Automobile Association's manager of federal affairs Devin Gladden, as quoted by Reuters.
 In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 3.1 million barrels for the week to July 23, with production at 4.7 million bpd. This compared with a draw of 1.3 million barrels for the previous week and a production rate of 4.9 million bpd. Some airlines have been struggling with jet fuel shortages recently in some smaller U.S. airports, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The shortage is the result of something of a perfect storm of a strong rebound in air travel and devastating wildfires, which have combined to push up demand for the distillate fuel.

The Best Risk Reward Plays In Oil.html,"Oil prices have been ticking upwards after OPEC+ reached an agreement on Sunday that will see the group start adding 400,000 bpd production each month from August. Goldman Sachs says the agreement is modestly bullish and has forecast that Brent will hit $80 per barrel this summer. Piper Sandler says that whereas the backdrop of tighter monetary policy, the trajectory of the economic recovery, and the sustainability of inflation are likely to create some volatility curveballs, they will not be enough to derail the secular bull market. Meanwhile, the fossil fuel sector is enjoying a rare blowout season: Over the past few earnings seasons, the majority of companies in the energy sector have comfortably beat Wall Street's expectations With impressive bottom-line growth, many top energy names are returning more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Companies usually repurchase shares when they believe they are undervalued, a big endorsement for oil and gas bulls. The biggest gainers in the current environment are integrated oil companies such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which own assets that run the whole gamut of the oil business, including drilling (upstream) and processing (downstream). However, the latest oil price downturn has reminded us that these companies also tend to be highly volatile because their business model is heavily reliant on commodity prices. To build a well-balanced and diversified portfolio, you need to invest in the midstream sector that carries less commodity price risk. Midstream oil companies provide the pipelines, processing, storage, and transportation, and processing assets that help move oil and gas commodities from the point of production to their eventual consumption points. Many midstream companies are fee-based, meaning their businesses depend more on commodity demand and are less affected by commodity price swings because demand tends to be more stable while prices tend to be more volatile. Another big draw: Midstream energy companies are some of the highest dividend payers, with many sporting yields above 6%. That said, midstream energy companies are not without risk. Just like the rest of the oil and gas sector, the U.S. midstream oil and gas segment was disrupted by the plunge in global energy demand spawned by the coronavirus pandemic. Many saw their market values cut in half, with huge pullbacks in production as well as a ramping down of capacity by refineries, liquefaction facilities, and exporters, as well as rampant project cancellations all taking a heavy toll. Nevertheless, last year was an outlier, and we are not likely to see anything that dramatic in the near future. Here are our top picks in the midstream oil sector. Enbridge Inc.  Market Cap: $78.7B Dividend Yield: 7.11% If you prefer an energy stock that offers a rare combination of high yield and growth, then look no further than Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB), a Canadian energy transportation company based in Alberta. Enbridge owns a network of transportation and storage assets that connect some of North America's richest oil and gas fields. As low-cost shale drilling continues to grow the continent's energy production volumes, Enbridge should be able to see healthy demand for its pipeline and transportation facilities. This midstream energy company sports a healthy dividend yield with a target to grow the dividend at 10% per annum while at the same time maintaining an impressive distributable cash flow ratio of 1.4x forward dividend.
 Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Market Cap: $51.4B Dividend Yield (Fwd): 7.65% Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EP) is the top transporter of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and also owns the most NGL fractionation capacity in the United States, as well as dock space for exports. Enterprise Products is the largest midstream MLP in the country. Enterprise has clearly read the signs of the times and has begun to work with partners to scale back its project backlog. In the past, EP was able to weather the normal industry headwinds thanks to robust cash coverage and manageable leverage. Unfortunately, Covid-19 has been anything but your average downturn, and EP has been forced to seriously cut back on Capex. After spending $17 billion in capital projects in 2015-19, including new oil pipelines, NGL and LPG pipeline-and-export facilities, and NGL fractionation plants, the giant MLP now plans to spend a combined $4 billion in 2021-22. These dramatic cuts are expected to pay off big time in higher earnings and distributions. Phillips 66 Partners  Market Cap: $8.4B Dividend Yield (Fwd): 9.56% Phillips 66 Partners (NYSE:PSX) is a midstream company founded in 2013 as a subsidiary of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). Phillips Partners owns 75% of its MLP's limited shares, providing crucial support for revenues and financing. Indeed, PSXP has one of the strongest balance sheets of the refining-sponsored MLPs, with a huge dividend that appears well covered. The main risk when investing in PSXP hinges on whether the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) will eventually be shut following a permitting dispute. But with states and municipalities starving for tax revenues and jobs amid Covid-19, this does not look like something that's likely to happen any time soon. In July 2020, a District Court judge issued a ruling for the pipeline to be shut down and emptied of oil pending a new environmental review. The temporary shutdown order was overturned by a U.S. appeals court on August 5, though the environmental review is expected to continue. Back in May, Reuters reported that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it does not believe a judge should order the Dakota Access oil pipeline shut while environmental review continues. Master Limited Partnerships
 For decades, master limited partnerships, or MLPs, have been a source of reliable, high-yield income for energy investors. An MLP is required by law to derive at least 90% of its cash flow from commodities, natural resources, or real estate. They, in turn, distribute cash to shareholders instead of paying dividends like a standard company would. MLPs combine the liquidity of publicly traded companies and the tax benefits of private partnerships because profits are taxed only when investors receive distributions.  Related: Mexico's Drug Cartels Are Stealing Oil Again The biggest draw of MLPs is that they are considered pass-through entities under the U.S. federal tax code. Whereas most corporate earnings are taxed twice (first through earnings and again through dividends), pass-through status of MLPs allows them to avoid this double taxation because earnings are not taxed at the corporate level. Another key benefit: Midstream MLPs act as toll collectors for the energy companies that use their pipelines. As such, their cash flows are protected by long-term, take-or-pay agreements, meaning they are less susceptible to commodity price fluctuations. It's, therefore, hardly surprising that MLPs typically pay the highest distributions in the energy sector. Here are some top payers. MPLX LP Market Cap:$28.8B Dividend Yield (Fwd): 9.85% MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX) is an Ohio-based crude oil and natural gas transportation and processing company.  MPLX has been making good progress reducing operating and capital expenses as well as securing and developing joint venture growth projects. In addition, parent company Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) recently completed the sale of its Speedway assets for $21 billion, with the proceeds to be used to pay down debt and shore up the company's balance sheet. Rattler Midstream LP Market Cap: $1.5B Dividend Yield: 8.57% Rattler Midstream LP (NASDAQ:RTLR) provides water-related services to oil and gas shale producer Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) in the Permian Basin in West Texas.  Rattler's management has been aggressively cutting back on capital expenditure which has helped support sustained free cash flow generation. Further, Rattler Midstream is not present on all the company acreage of Diamondback Energy which allows it to grow revenue at a time when Diamondback Energy has forecast a period of no growth.

Refiners Face Huge Long Term Challenges.html,"The global refining industry has not recovered yet from the impact of the pandemic, but it is already facing longer-term challenges with the energy transition. Over the next decade and a half, global fuel demand will likely decline, leading to an overcapacity in the refining market, lower margins, and lower utilization. The outlook varies across regions. Generally speaking, however, some less efficient refineries will have to close because of downward pressure on profits amid lower demand and unnecessary high global capacity, McKinsey & Company said in its report ‘Global downstream outlook to 2035’ published this month.   The outlook examines global liquids demand in three different policy scenarios and the impact that demand would have on refiners globally and in various regions. The refining industry is likely to shrink in some regions, but it will still remain a large sector that would likely keep in the 2030s as much as 90 percent of its 2019 operating capacity, McKinsey & Company noted. Just as with the recovery from COVID-19, the long-term prospects of the downstream sector will vary across scenarios and regions. There will be winners and losers. Reference Case – 5 Million Bpd Refinery Closures, 35% Shrinking Value McKinsey’s reference case, Energy Transition, in which future policies will follow current patterns, finds that Europe and the U.S. may need to shut down permanently as much as 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of capacity by 2035. Roughly half of those closures have already been announced, the company said.
 In McKinsey’s Energy Transition scenario, global liquids demand peaks in 2029 at 104 million bpd, with road transport fuels peaking in 2023. Refining margins are set to recover once refinery rationalization occurs, but U.S. and European margins will be around $2 a barrel lower in 2031–2035 than in recent history. If energy and climate policies follow current patterns, the value of global refining is set to drop by 36 percent from 2015–19 levels by the 2030s, with the 2031–35 global average at $100 billion. During the 2030s, only Asia and the Middle East will see its refining industry grow in value, according to McKinsey. This assessment is generally in line with previous estimates from other energy experts and consultants who say that Asia and the Middle East, especially the newer integrated refining complexes, will beat older refineries in countries where fuel demand is expected to be less resilient in the energy transition. If the global refinery industry doesn’t see extensive further rationalization, the sector may never return to 80 percent capacity utilization, Wood MacKenzie said earlier this month. The current crisis is an existential threat to smaller and less efficient refineries in Europe and Asia that were struggling to turn profits even before the pandemic. Even oil majors acknowledge that some sites have become permanently uneconomical amid depressed refining margins, fierce regional competition, and expectations of declining road fuel demand in the long term. For example, ExxonMobil and BP announced in the span of just a few months closures of their respective refineries in Australia. They now plan to convert them into fuel import terminals.   According to McKinsey, while Europe and the U.S. could recover faster from the pandemic impact in the short term, Asia’s refiners will be more resilient in the long term. As a whole, the reference case found that the industry will remain a large one, but it will become less profitable. Delayed Transition To Grow Refinery Value To $181 Billion If economic recovery from COVID takes precedence over emissions reduction and the energy transition slows down, global liquids demand will continue to grow through 2035, with light product demand peaking in 2029, McKinsey says.
 Related: Could This Be The Most Promising Oil Play Of The Decade?  Utilization will remain strong, and Asia and the Middle East will even add 1.3 million bpd of capacity. Asia and the Middle East will also drive a 16 percent rise in value in the refining industry to a global average of $181 billion in 2031–2035.   Accelerated Transition To Lead To 16 Million Bpd Refinery Closures If the transition accelerates, it would bring about peak global liquids demand in 2024 at 101 million bpd, while light product demand will never recover to 2019 levels, McKinsey’s analysis shows. In this case, all markets, especially Europe and the United States, would require as much as 16 million bpd of unannounced closures by 2035. In this case, the value of the refining industry would plunge in the 2030s to 74 percent compared with 2015–2019 levels, at $40 billion global average in 2031–2035.   The actual scenario that will unfold could be close to the reference case or a combination of two or three of those examined by McKinsey. At any rate, some things are certain—refiners will take time to overcome the COVID-19 shock. At the same time, they will be bracing for the long-term impact of the energy transition. Refiners should be ready to adapt to lower long-term refining margins, industry rationalization with millions of bpd of capacity closures, and a long-term decline in profits.   ",Positive
Venezuela Plans To Revive Its Oil Industry Despite US Sanctions.html,"Venezuela is ignoring U.S. sanctions with its plan to boost production to 1.5 million bpd by the end of the year, around three times the current output. A document has been released showing that Venezuela has received delivery of condensate from the Rene supertanker in its Jose port. After national production broke down, Venezuela came to rely on condensate imports to thin its extra-heavy crude grades for processing. Due to U.S. sanctions on the country, introduced in 2019 in response to the dictatorship, Venezuela has not been able to produce and export its normal quantities of oil, also finding it difficult to access oil-related products such as condensate, vital for production.  New condensate imports reflect Venezuela’s eagerness to reinvigorate its oil industry. With nearly 300 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, Venezuela holds the most oil in the world, and pre-sanction production stood at around 2.4 million bpd, with room to grow. The country now needs to resume production if it hopes to stabilize the national economy and improve employment opportunities.  The country has already managed to get around many restrictions with the help of intermediaries, through its strong partnership with China. China Concord Petroleum Co., Limited, CCPC, has long been tied to Iranian oil, much to the disdain of the USA. However, it seems that it is now also getting involved with Venezuelan oil. 
 Despite threats from the U.S. that it will impose sanctions on any entity aiding the oil industries of sanctioned countries, such as Iran and Venezuela, CCPC started working with Venezuelan oil firms alongside independent Chinese refiners earlier in 2021, bringing 14 tankers within the last year to ship crude oil out of both Venezuela and Iran. China has long opposed U.S. sanctions on oil. ""China strongly opposes unilateral sanctions and urges the United States to remove the 'long-arm jurisdiction' on companies and individuals,"" stated a spokesman for China's foreign ministry. In June, exports of oil from Venezuela rose significantly ahead of a new import tax imposed by China, which raised import costs by around 40 percent, according to state-run oil firm PDVSA. Related: Could This Be The Most Promising Oil Play Of The Decade?  PDVSA and partners exported an average of 631,900 bpd of crude and refined products, up 6.5 percent in May and 66 percent from the same month last year. Most of these products were bound for Asia, with around 238,000 going to Malaysia for trans-shipping and mixing before reaching their final destination of China. Other export destinations included the UAE and Cuba. 
 The question is whether the U.S. will continue to overlook Venezuela’s work with intermediaries to bolster its oil industry. Particularly after U.S. officials threatened new oil trade links between Iran and China with more sanctions, just last week. The leniency seen from the U.S. could come to an end at any moment should it decide to impose stricter sanctions on Venezuela and its partners.  But exceptions to sanctions have already been made this year, with the U.S. agreeing to allow imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) into Venezuela earlier this month. Such imports were not permitted under the Trump administration. President Biden acknowledged the need for LPG in the country, used as cooking fuel and currently in limited supply, driving people to burn wood. So, just how far can Venezuela push the U.S. before more sanctions are imposed? Over the next few months, it will become clearer as to whether the huge oil nation will reach its goal of tripling production as it strives to reinvigorate its mammoth oil industry. ",Positive
India May Join China In Bid To Lower Oil Prices.html,"The world’s third-largest crude oil importer, India, could join China in tapping into its strategic petroleum reserve in a bid to sell lower-priced crude to its refiners amid rallying international oil prices. India is reportedly considering selling half of its SPR to attract private participation in expanding its strategic storage capacity, government sources told Reuters last week. The sale of crude from reserves could also be a move from one of the importers most sensitive to price hikes to reduce the price of crude for its refiners, Reuters columnist Clyde Russell says. India’s SPR currently holds around 36.5 million barrels of crude oil. 
 India has been the most vocal critic of the OPEC+ production reduction pact this year, saying that it does not support “artificial cuts to keep the price going up.” On several occasions, India’s top officials have criticized OPEC+ for keeping the market tight and prices high and have expressed concern that the higher crude and fuel prices in India would slow down the economic and oil demand recovery. India’s move to commercialize half of its SPR is primarily aimed at raising financing for additional SPR storage, but it could also ensure cheaper oil from storage to Indian refiners, according to Reuters’ Russell. 
 Last week, reports emerged that the world’s top oil importer, China, is looking to tap its crude reserves. China has started to release more than 20 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic reserve in a move seen as seeking to curb the recent oil price rally, Energy Intelligence reported last week, quoting trading sources. The reported release from the strategic petroleum reserve is also aimed at putting inflation under control. Various market and trade sources told Energy Intelligence that China was about to release the equivalent of between 22 million barrels and over 29 million barrels, or between 3 million and 4 million tons.",Negative
Libya Looks To Boost Oil Production To 16 Million Bpd In 2022.html,"Libya could boost its oil production to 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) by the middle of 2022 if the industry has the necessary funding, Libya’s Oil Minister Mohamed Oun told Italian news agency Agenzia Nova in an interview published this week. Currently, the North African producer exempted from the OPEC+ cuts pumps around 1.2 million bpd. According to secondary sources in OPEC’s latest Monthly Oil Market Report, Libya’s crude oil production averaged 1.163 million bpd in June, up from 1.157 million bpd in May. Since getting a unity government in March and a petroleum minister for the first time in five years, Libya has vowed it would raise its oil production, provided that the National Oil Corporation (NOC) receives the necessary funds.
 Libya plans to raise its oil production to 1.45 million bpd by the end of this year, Mustafa Sanalla, the chairman of NOC, told Bloomberg Television in an interview earlier this year.  Libya will be able to increase its current production by year’s end, provided that the state oil firm is not compromised again, according to Sanalla.
 The targets for the next few years are for Libya to increase production to 1.6 million bpd in two years and to 2.1 million bpd in four years, NOC’s chairman told Bloomberg in March. Libya surprised many oil market observers, and probably the OPEC+ group itself, after managing in just a few months to restore its oil production back to 1.25 million bpd from less than 100,000 in September 2020. The 1.25 million bpd level was the volume Libya was pumping before the eighth-month-long oil port blockade began in January 2020. Even after the lifting of the blockade in mid-September and the ceasefire from October, Libya’s oil production has not been entirely stable so far this year due to strikes from the Petroleum Facilities Guard over unpaid salaries and the lack of funds for restoration and maintenance of oil infrastructure. ",Negative
Iraq Wants Other US Oil Company To Replace Exxon.html,"Iraq wants another U.S. company to replace Exxon as a shareholder in the West Qurna 1 field, one of the country's largest after the supermajor leaves the country. ""Exxon Mobil is considering exiting Iraq for reasons that are to do with its internal management practices, decisions, and not because of the particular situation in Iraq,"" Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi told media after a meeting with President Joe Biden, as quoted by Reuters. Exxon, which holds a $32.7-percent interest in West Qurna 1, has been looking for a buyer with plans to exit the country entirely. The stake was valued last year at up to $500 million. At the time, reports said two Chinese companies were interested in acquiring it, state-owned CNPC and CNOOC.
 The plans for the stake sale appear to have been prompted by the impact the pandemic had on Exxon's finances as it sought to keep its dividend intact and reduce debt. Later reports said that Iraq could end up buying the West Qurna 1 stake itself. There could be other reasons for Exxon leaving Iraq, too. As Gerald Jansen wrote for Oilprice earlier this month, these have to do with the souring relationship between the company and Baghdad after Exxon ventured into Kurdistan oil, and with the continued political and financial instability in Iraq. This, according to Jansen, may have compromised the profitability of whatever plans Exxon may have had for its Iraqi business earlier. Just two years ago, Exxon was all set to take part in a $53-billion plan to boost Iraq's oil production, but it seems the pandemic and the Iraqi situation changed many things, including this ambitious plan.
 ""When Exxon Mobil departs, we will not accept its replacement to be other than another American company,"" Prime Minister Kadhimi told media this week, but an American company has yet to express interest in acquiring Exxon's holdings in Iraq.",Positive
Argentinas Oil Industry Is Finally Bouncing Back.html,"While the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020’s oil price collapse hit Argentina’s hydrocarbon sector hard, leading to some analysts to claim that it may never fully recover, there is evidence of a healthy rebound is underway. This is especially positive news for the national government in Buenos Aires which for nearly a decade has pinned its hopes on fueling an economic revival by exploiting the massive hydrocarbon wealth of the Vaca Muerta shale play. The massive shale play, located in the oil-rich Neuquén province, is thought to hold recoverable hydrocarbon resources consisting of 16 billion barrels of oil and 308 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Those numbers make the Vaca Muerta the world’s second-largest shale gas deposit. The shale formation is often compared to the prolific U.S. Eagle Ford shale, although unlike the U.S: shale play the Vaca Muerta’s dry gas window has proven to be commercially viable. For those reasons it is easy to understand why Buenos Aires views the hydrocarbon-rich geological formation as a silver bullet for Argentina’s economic woes, especially after May 2020 when Buenos Aires defaulted on its sovereign debt for the second time in 20 years. The Vaca Muerta shale play along with Argentina’s overall oil industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Since hydrocarbon production (Spanish) bottomed during May 2020 it has been steadily climbing with oil output reaching a 12-month high of 504,119 barrels per day, a 13% increase over the same period a year ago. Natural gas production, however, declined by 2.6% to be 762,672 barrels of oil equivalent daily. As a result, Argentina’s overall hydrocarbon production of 1.27 million barrels of oil equivalent per day was only 3% higher year over year.  Source: Argentina Ministry of Economy and U.S. EIA. It is Argentina’s national oil company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales SA known as YPF, which has become the driving force behind developing the Vaca Muerta. For that reason, there were fears that a liquidity crisis caused by a large portion of YPF’s debt falling due in March 2021 would derail the state-controlled oil company’s planned investment to develop the shale play. YPF was eventually able to resolve that worrying development through a debt swap, which has had no lasting material impact on its planned development of the Vaca Muerta.
 Activity in the shale formation is ramping up at a solid clip. Even the April 2021 protests, where healthcare workers blockaded roads to the Vaca Muerta, have had little material impact. YPF earmarked an investment of $1.5 billion to develop its assets in Neuquén province where the Vaca Muerta shale play is located. Argentina’s national oil company intends to use that investment to boost provincial oil production by 56% and natural gas output by 70% during 2021. French energy supermajor Total Energies announced in April 2021 that it had approved the development of the Aguada Pichana Este license, located in the Vaca Muerta, and increased its stake in the operation from just over 27% to 41%. Anglo-Dutch supermajor Shell continues to make significant investments in the shale formation. The integrated energy supermajor is pressing ahead (Spanish) with an $80 million investment to build a 120,000 barrel per day 105-kilometer-long pipeline in the Vaca Muerta. Data from Baker Hughes showing that drilling activity is steadily increasing. By the end of June 2021, there were 45 active rigs, according to Baker Hughes, which was the same as a month prior but is notably significantly higher than the six active rigs at the end of the same period in 2020.  Source: Baker Hughes and U.S. EIA.
 An Argus Media article shows that during June 2021 985 fracking stages were completed in the Vaca Muerta, which while being 9% lower than May when a record 1,079 stages were completed, was still an impressive five times greater than a year earlier. It was YPF which is leading investment in the shale formation completing 532 fracking stages or 54% of those conducted during June. Those solid numbers for both the rig count and fracking operations indicate that the tempo of operations in the Vaca Muerta is growing at a solid clip boding well for further oil and natural gas production to keep expanding.  Related: Climate Friendly Banks: The Key To A Sustainable Energy Transformation? International energy companies are committed to making substantial investments in the Vaca Muerta despite Argentina’s high breakeven price per barrel. Analysts and industry insiders estimate that on average oilfields across Latin America’s fifth-largest oil producer have a breakeven price of $45 per barrel. New projects in the Vaca Muerta are projected to have a breakeven price of over $50 per barrel which during periods of sharply weaker oil prices has deterred investment. Those breakeven prices are significantly higher than other regional producers including Brazil, Guyana, Colombia, and Ecuador. YPF is, however, focused on reducing drilling costs with Pablo Iuliano, YPF's vice president of unconventional upstream telling S&P Global Platts at the end of 2020 that the company is driving efficiencies to push the breakeven price below $30 per barrel. There are signs that such a significant decrease can be achieved, particularly as further infrastructure is developed in the Vaca Muerta. Impressively, YPF reported for the last twelve months combined lifting and development costs of $14.60 per barrel which is 8% lower than for the full year 2020, boding well for lower breakeven prices. If breakeven prices fall below $30 per barrel YPF’s shale hydrocarbon production will be highly profitable and resilient to weaker oil prices. Such a breakeven price would be among the lowest in South America, enhancing the attractiveness of the Vaca Muerta as a destination for investment by foreign energy companies. The appeal of investing in Argentina’s energy patch is enhanced by the primary crude oil grade produced, Escalante, being particularly sweet with a sulfur content of 0.19% and an API gravity of 24.1 degrees. This is important because the demand for low sulfur content medium and light crude oil grades is steadily expanding because of every stricter sulfur emission regulation for fuels. There are even reports of Escalante cargoes being exported to the Middle East during 2020, while China’s thirst for sweet medium and light crude oil grades continues to grow. A key deterrent for many foreign energy companies when it comes to investing in Argentina is a long history of the government meddling with the petroleum industry. This has included punitive regulatory and tax environments, artificial pricing and even the nationalization of privately owned assets. For those reasons, the leftist government of President Alberto Fernandez must convince foreign oil companies that it can establish a stable, transparent regulatory framework with market-based pricing where profits can be easily repatriated without punitive taxes being applied. The latest developments indicate that Buenos Aires may be finally on the path to realizing the vast hydrocarbon potential held by the Vaca Muerta, which will give Argentina’s beaten-down economy a solid boost.",Positive
Iraq Oil Expert Baghdad Shouldnt Replace Oil With Renewables.html,"It is not in Iraq's best interest to adopt renewable energy at the expense of fossil fuels, energy and oil expert Hamza al-Jawaheri told local Shafaq News Agency in an interview on Monday. Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia, has been suffering from power outages and disruptions due to a lack of investment in its transmission grids. Iraq also relies on electricity and natural gas imports from neighboring Iran for its power supply and has received waivers from the United States to continue importing electricity from Iran despite the American sanctions against Tehran. ""Iraq is an oil-producing country. It supplies 12% of the world's needs. It is not in its best interest to adopt renewable energy resources,"" al-Jawaheri told Shafaq News Agency.
 ""Iraq's economy is rentier that relies on oil to fund its treasury. Promoting alternative energy is not the optimal choice to address the power issue in Iraq,"" the energy analyst was quoted by the news agency as saying. According to al-Jawaheri, solar energy installations are useless in urban areas, as well as ""four times more expensive than fossil oil.""

Top Oilfield Service Providers See Multi Year Recovery Ahead.html,"The three largest oilfield services providers in the world expect the vaccine-driven recovery in global oil demand to continue through the coming quarters and lead to the next upcycle in demand for oil drilling and completions. Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL), which generates the largest share of its revenues from North America, was the first to report last week its Q2 financials and give an estimate about the industry going forward. Improved North American and international markets for drilling, completion, and production helped Halliburton book a higher net profit for the second quarter than analysts had estimated. Halliburton also reported rising revenues both in North America and internationally and higher operating income quarter over quarter as the markets continued to improve, said the company. “The positive activity momentum we see in North America and international markets today, combined with our expectations for future customer demand, gives us conviction for an unfolding multi-year upcycle,” said Jeff Miller, Halliburton’s chairman, president, and CEO.
 Baker Hughes, whose Q2 loss was smaller than the losses booked for Q2 2020 and Q1 2021, reported stronger revenues and orders and continues to see improving demand. “As we look ahead to the second half of 2021, we see continued signs of global economic recovery that should drive further demand growth for oil and natural gas. Although we recognize the risks presented by the variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, we expect spending and activity levels to gain momentum through the year as the macro environment improves, likely setting up the industry for stronger growth in 2022,” Baker Hughes chairman and CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.  Schlumberger turned to a net profit of $431 million for Q2, compared to a loss of $3.4 billion for the same period of 2020.
 “In North America, revenue grew 11% sequentially, representing the highest sequential quarterly growth rate for this area since the third quarter of 2017,” Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch said, commenting on the Q2 2021 performance. “With oil price at elevated levels, the supply response to this demand recovery is developing broadly as anticipated. Indeed, this combination has resulted in a call on short-cycle production as well as an uptick in long-cycle project, reflected in new FIDs and encouraging recovery in both offshore developments and near-field exploration activity through the second quarter,” Le Peuch said on the earnings call on Friday.",Positive
US Rig Count Climbs As Oil Prices Recoup Losses.html,"The number of oil and gas rigs in the United States is up 7 this week, according to Baker Hughes, which pegged the total rig count at 491, up 240 from the same time last year. The U.S. oil rig count rose by 7 this week to 387. The number of gas rigs stayed the same at 104. The number of miscellaneous rigs also stayed the same. The EIA’s estimate for oil production in the United States for the week ending July 16 stayed the same at an average of 11.4 million barrels per day. Production is still well below the 13.1 million bpd peak seen in February 2020.
 Canada’s overall rig count fell this week by 1. Oil and gas rigs in Canada now sit at 149 active rigs, up 107 on the year.  The rig count in the Permian basin increased by 4 this week. At 242 rigs, the Permian’s total rig count is now 116 rigs above what it was this time last year.  Check out all rig count data on our Rig Count page The Frac Spread Count provided by Primary Vision shows that fracking crews rose by 4 for the week ending July 16, up to 242. The frac spread count estimates the number of completion crews finishing off previously drilled wells. This frac count is up by more than 110 so far this year.

Middle East Oil Giants Grapple With Cyberattacks.html,"As the global oil and gas markets are recovering from the steep sell-off last Monday, threats in the market are not just linked to demand-supply concerns. Cybersecurity specialists reported this week that hackers managed to get access to a large amount of data from Saudi oil giant Aramco. The company has confirmed that around 1TB of (confidential) data was stolen from its servers. According to AP sources, the data has been put on offer on the darknet for a price of $50 million. It is at present still unknown who is behind the data theft, but some are also worried about the fact that no additional information is being given by the parties involved. The world’s largest listed oil company Aramco has been targeted by cyberattacks on a regular basis, such as the well-known Iran-instigated Shamoon virus attacks. This most recent attack on Aramco, shows that there remains a lot of work to be done to protect the oil giant against future data breaches, ransomware attacks, and industrial espionage. The Aramco data breach shows again the threat to energy supply comes not just from drone and missile attacks, but also from cyberattacks. Since the Shamoon attack, which brought a large part of the Saudi giant to a standstill, major cybersecurity programs have been proposed and implemented by the Saudis. However, even a trillion-dollar company seems to be unable to fully protect its digital infrastructure.  For financial stakeholders, the current situation is of course of interest. Saudi Aramco is implementing a major company restructuring strategy, focusing on mid-and downstream assets. The 1TB data breach is linked according to sources especially to downstream assets and operations. Potential pressure from this ‘third party contractor breach” on divestments or privatization plans, such as the Aramco pipeline project, should be not dismissed straight away. If the available data is much more in detail, especially on price settings or financial strategies, the damage could be much larger than currently presented in the press.  Related: Is The Fear Of Nuclear Energy Justified? Sources are stating that “Zero-day exploitation"" has been used to get access to servers. The data is now being offered by a threat actor group known as ZeroX . In statements made by ZeroX, the 1TB of data has been stolen in 2020 by hacking Aramco's ""network and its servers"". The total data includes files from 1993 to 2020. On the darknet and other sites on the internet, ZeroX has posted samples of Aramco's blueprints and proprietary documents. The first data was already posted on a data breach marketplace forum in June this year:
  The total data set, based on the initial posting on the so-called .onion leak site had a countdown timer set to 662 hours, or about 28 days, after which the sale and negotiations would begin. While it’s not exactly clear why the hackers went with a 662 hour deadline, but ZeroX reportedly has said that the choice of ""662 hours,"" was intentional and a ""puzzle"" for Saudi Aramco to solve, but the exact reason behind the choice remains unclear. In an info piece, ZeroX has also stated that the 1TB dump includes documents linked to Saudi Aramco's refineries located in multiple Saudi Arabian cities, including Yanbu, Jazan, Jeddah, Ras Tanura, Riyadh, and Dhahran. Some other info shows that it includes: BleepingComputer reports that samples released by ZeroX on the leak site have personally identifiable information (PII) redacted, and a 1 GB sample alone costs US$2,000, paid through the cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). ZeroX also has stated that the price of the entire 1 TB dump is set at US$5 million if a party wants the exclusive rights for a one-off sale (i.e. obtain the complete 1 TB dump and demand it be wiped completely from ZeroX's end) it needs to pay a whopping US$50 million.  Related: Oil Prices Recover After Manic Monday
 All parties, including ZeroX and Aramco, have reiterated that the incident is not a ransomware attack. Aramco has repeated that the breach happened at third-party contractors and that Aramco’s systems were not directly involved. A company spokesman repeated that the company continues to maintain a robust cybersecurity posture. Looking at the 2012 Shamoon attack, which destroyed 30,000 computer hard drives of Aramco, the current breach is less dangerous. Still, when looking at recent global ransomware and other cyber-related attacks, such as the Colonial Pipeline or European supermarkets, the threat to Aramco, and possibly other Arab national oil companies is real.  Some also have stated that the ZeroX attack is a first of maybe a list of upcoming cyber attacks on Aramco. Even though the current data breach was executed through third-party contractors, it shows that hackers managed to find loopholes in the cybersecurity systems of oil and gas companies.  Analysts will be scratching their heads in the coming months on how to deal with and prevent these data breaches or Shamoon 2.0 ransomware attacks. The current digitalization of oil and gas, including upstream, down- and midstream operations is not only a positive development. The huge amount of sensors, datapoints, information-gathering operations, and real-time monitoring, in principle to lower costs and increase profit margins, has become a weak spot for companies. As cyber warfare strategies of global and regional powers are advancing, attacks could become a lot more sophisticated and the oil and gas industry is expected to remain a key target. Additionally, one should take statements about cybersecurity by government or company officials in the Middle East with a pinch of salt. No company or government official will ever show the back of his tongue when asked to comment. If the 2012 Shamoon case is a baseline for assessments and the discrepancies between official statements and reality, the current situation could be much worse than expected. ",Negative
Deadly Typhoon Threatens Strategic Chinese Oil Hub.html,"The In-fa typhoon, which caused devastating flooding in parts of China this week—claiming at least 33 lives—is expected to make landfall this weekend in a key area hosting some of the largest Chinese refineries and oil storage tanks. In-fa caused torrential rains and floods in the Chinese province of Henan earlier this week. Subway cars were flooded in flash floods in the capital city of the province, Zhengzhou. Twelve people were killed in a flooded subway line after being trapped for hours. Thousands of people in Henan, one of the most populous provinces in China, have been displaced. The In-fa typhoon is now expected to make landfall in the province of Zhejiang during the weekend, a coastal province home to some of China’s newest and largest oil refineries and numerous bunkering docks.
 Earlier this week, Zhoushan, the island in the Zhejiang province, halted bunker operations ahead of the expected landfall of the In-fa typhoon on Sunday, Argus reported. Apart from major ship-refueling operations, the Zhejiang province is also home to Zhejiang Petroleum & Chemical’s newest oil complex in Zhoushan. The Zhenhai refinery owned by Sinopec is also close to the path of the typhoon. 
 On Friday, China activated its second-highest alert due to the In-fa typhoon, issuing an orange alert for the storm now expected to make landfall between Sunday afternoon and Monday morning in the province of Zhejiang. According to some weather forecasts, In-fa could cause catastrophic flooding in China on Sunday, including in one of the largest cities and financial centers in China, Shanghai. Before landing in China, the typhoon is expected to bring inclement weather to some islands in Japan. In-fa is the first major typhoon to hit the eastern parts of China this year during the peak typhoon season from July to September. ",Negative
China Could See Slowest Oil Import Growth In Two Decades.html,"High oil prices and China’s crackdown on the use of oil import quotas could result in the lowest crude oil import growth at the world’s top oil importer since 2001, analysts tell Reuters. Analysts—including Rystad Energy, Energy Aspects, and Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS)—estimate that the recent clampdown on the import and tax practices of independent refiners, as well as the significantly higher oil prices this year, could result in flat or slightly rising crude oil imports in China in 2021. Oil imports could grow by up to 2 percent in 2021 compared to 2020, which would be the lowest growth rate in two decades and much lower than the 9.7-percent average import growth rate since 2015, according to Reuters. In a bid to reduce refining overcapacity, China stepped up earlier this year pressure on independent refiners to uproot illegal tax practices and check if outdated facilities have been closed as required. The authorities are checking to see whether the private refiners are complying with all laws and regulations when importing and later reporting and booking processing rates and taxes. The Rise of the Teapots
 A broad clampdown on private Chinese refiners could impact the crude import rates of the world’s top oil importer, considering that the independents have grown to account for around one-fifth of China’s crude oil imports.  Those teapots were first allowed to purchase oil from abroad in 2015. Imports Already Down YoY
 China’s crude oil imports fell to some 9.77 million barrels per day (bpd) in June 2021. They were down 2 percent in May, which was the lowest monthly level since the start of the year, according to customs data cited by Reuters. Over the first half of the year, China imported 260.66 million tons of crude—or 10.51 million bpd per Reuters estimates. This was a 3 percent drop compared to the first half of 2020.  The Record Breakers Meanwhile, Chinese refiners processed a record amount of crude oil in June, at 14.8 million bpd, up by 3.9 percent from May when run rates also broke records, statistics data showed. The average daily run rates for the first half of the year were even higher, at 15.13 million barrels—up by 10.7 percent from a year earlier, the data also showed.",Negative
US Shale Sees Light At The End Of The Tunnel.html,"The U.S. oil and gas sector is recovering from last year’s market slump. But unlike the previous boom-and-bust cycles, the industry has held off on boosting production and has focused on strengthening balance sheets, repaying loans, and rewarding shareholders. As a result of the rallying commodity prices this year, and most of all, the discipline in capital spending, the U.S. shale patch is now financially stronger. Bankruptcies have been fewer and far apart in recent months, and the energy loan default rate has dropped to the lowest level since the oil market crashed in March and April last year. In addition, low interest rates have prompted many U.S. oil and gas firms to raise new debt, most of which goes to repaying existing liabilities, not to drilling more wells. U.S. Energy Defaults Drop Significantly One indicator shows that the credit quality of the loans and bonds in the U.S. oil and gas sector has significantly improved in recent months. The energy sector’s trailing twelve-month (TTM) default rate stood at 9.1 percent in July, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Wednesday. The energy default rate has fallen below the double-digit percentage for the first time since April 2020. The default rate is also considerably down from the 20.3-percent peak in March, Fitch Ratings noted.  Related: The Best 2 Stocks To Hold As Oil Prices Explode Smaller defaults and higher oil prices are set to further push the energy default rate down to 5 percent by the end of this year, the rating agency says. This year will see smaller defaults compared with as many as four defaults of $1.5 billion-plus size issuers in 2020, according to Fitch Ratings.  To compare, at this time last year, Fitch Ratings was estimating the energy default rate to finish the year 2020 at 18 percent. In the second quarter of 2020 alone, energy generated $5 billion of defaults. This year, Fitch Ratings does not expect “many bankruptcies coming in the next few months. Only 2% of our Top Market Concern Loans relates to energy,” Eric Rosenthal, Senior Director of Leveraged Finance at Fitch Ratings, told Forbes’ Senior Contributor Mayra Rodriguez Valladares. Defaults on bonds have also significantly dropped this year, according to Fitch Ratings.
 “Energy makes up only 10% of our Top Market Concern Bonds list, down from 57% as of one year ago. There has been only $3.2 billion of YTD high yield energy defaults compared with $14.4 billion for the same period in 2020,” Rosenthal told Rodriguez Valladares.  Energy Bankruptcies Slow Down This year, the default rate is considerably down, as companies with unsustainable liabilities have already filed for bankruptcy over the past year, while the others are using record cash flows to pay down debts. The number of North American producers that filed for bankruptcy protection in the first quarter of 2021 reached the highest number for a first-quarter since 2016, yet the wave of bankruptcies has significantly slowed since the peaks in the second and third quarter of 2020, law firm Haynes and Boone said in its latest tally to March 31. Even though the number of first-quarter 2021 bankruptcies was the highest for a Q1 since 2016, it showed the trend of slowing filings after 18 oil and gas producers filed in the second quarter of 2020 and another 17 in the third quarter, the two quarters in which the oil price crash and the crisis were most severely felt by indebted producers.  The U.S. Shale Patch Is Borrowing Again U.S. oil and gas firms are taking advantage of the high oil prices and historically low-interest rates to seek financing. Higher oil prices and low-interest rates have prompted listed independent U.S. oil producers to raise in March the most financing via debt and equity issues since August last year, the EIA said in April. This time around, the borrowed money is being used for repayment of previously drawn credit facilities or bonds, not for relentless drilling of new wells and chasing record production growth.  “Since crude oil prices began increasing, U.S. crude oil producers have been raising debt and equity to refinance debts, resume drilling activities, or purchase acreage,” the EIA said.
 Low corporate bond yields have also contributed to lower interest rates on new bonds and reduce the cost of issuing debt, the EIA noted. Historically low interest rates give additional incentives to U.S. shale drillers to raise new debt and refinance existing liabilities. Currently, it’s as cheap for the U.S. energy sector to raise new debt as it was seven years ago, when oil was $100 per barrel, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. How Long Will Discipline Hold? So far this year, U.S. oil and gas firms have been sticking with promises of capital discipline and prefer to show investors the money to drilling themselves “into oblivion,” as Harold Hamm warned back in 2017.  Related: Everything You Need To Know About OPEC’s New Agreement Higher oil prices and expected record cash flows could heal the balance sheets of many shale producers this year. Even if U.S. shale wanted to significantly raise production in response to $70 oil, it would take at least nine months to see a meaningful jump in output, Rystad Energy said in an analysis earlier this month.   One executive at an E&P firm may have summed up this year’s motto of the U.S. shale patch in the following comment in the Dallas Fed Energy Survey Q2 published at the end of June: “Don’t take the bait, drillers: Stay capital disciplined and enjoy the higher prices for your product.”   ",Positive
China Taps Into Crude Reserves To Curb Oil Price Rally.html,"The world’s top oil importer, China, has started to release more than 20 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic reserve in a move seen as seeking to curb the recent oil price rally, Energy Intelligence reported this week, quoting trading sources. The reported release from the strategic petroleum reserve is also aimed at putting inflation under control. Various market and trade sources told Energy Intelligence that China was about to release the equivalent of between 22 million barrels and over 29 million barrels, or between 3 million and 4 million tons.
 Sources with knowledge of China’s plans also told Bloomberg that the government had supplied to refiners earlier this month 22 million barrels of crude oil. The crude from the strategic reserve being supplied to Chinese refiners would displace part of the crude oil imports of the world’s top oil importer. China’s crude oil imports began to cool off as prices rallied. Now, its crude released from the strategic reserve could weaken Chinese imports further.
 China’s crude oil imports fell to around 9.77 million bpd in June, down by 2 percent on May and the lowest monthly level since the start of the year, customs data cited by Reuters showed last week. Over the first half of the year, China imported 260.66 million tons of crude, or 10.51 million bpd per Reuters estimates. This was a 3 percent drop compared to the first half of 2020. The first-half figure was boosted by increased imports by independent refiners. Since the first quarter, however, Beijing has begun cracking down on the teapots, as production of fuels both at independent refiners and state-owned majors was rising faster than demand, undermining refining margins and creating a glut.     ",Negative
Saudi Arabia Wants To Pump Every Last Molecule Of Oil.html,"After two weeks of impasse, the recent OPEC+ agreement has put Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman in the spotlight again for the power he yields on the global oil market. Abdulaziz bin Salman, like the other oilmen in Saudi Arabia, still believes that it will be the Kingdom that will pump the last barrel of oil, and it will be the Kingdom that will benefit from shrinking investments in oil and gas globally as international oil majors and governments continue to pledge net-zero emissions by 2050.   Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, one of the most influential – if not the most influential – figures in the oil market, believes that the Saudis will pump every last drop of oil. “We are still going to be the last man standing, and every molecule of hydrocarbon will come out,” Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a private event, a source familiar with the meeting told Bloomberg News’ Javier Blas.
 The energy minister is not the only top official to express the belief that Saudi Arabia will have a future in oil despite the net-zero and peak oil demand narratives. Before net-zero emissions became the latest fad in oil markets, Amin Nasser, president and chief executive officer of Saudi oil giant Saudi Aramco, said in January 2019 that Saudi Arabia would pump the last barrel of oil.  “There will continue to be growth in oil demand … We are the lowest cost producer and the last barrel will come from the region,” told CNN Business’ Emerging Markets Editor John Defterios on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2019.
 That was more than a year before the market crash of March and April 2020, when Saudi Arabia briefly broke up the OPEC+ pact with Russia. During the past two weeks amid the latest disagreement within OPEC+, Abdulaziz bin Salman was key in the negotiations with the UAE, which wanted its baseline production level revised up. “Consensus building is an art,” Abdulaziz bin Salman said after the deal was announced, declining to say how the consensus was built.",Positive
Houston Scrambles To Remain The Energy Capital Of The US.html,"The United States shale sector is at a crossroads. Houston, the capital of the nation’s oil and gas industry, is at the metaphorical and industrial center of a struggle for the country’s unfolding post-covid energy landscape. The writing is on the wall: the renewable revolution is here to stay, and while the sun hasn’t set on oil yet, the industry will never see growth the way that it has in the past couple of decades. Oil is still highly relevant in Houston, but that is going to change, whether oil tycoons and Texas politicians like it or not.  Even one of the city’s top oil bankers agrees that Houston needs to join the clean energy transition or risk being left behind. “If Houston wants to continue to be the world’s leading energy capital, then it’s going to need to be a leader in the newer forms of energy,” Bobby Tudor, chair of the Houston-based investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, was quoted by the Financial Times in a recent report. He’s not alone in this assertion -- far from it. Tudor’s just one voice in what is becoming an increasingly bipartisan chorus pushing for the United States fossil fuel sector to accept the changing global reality. Earlier this year, President Biden’s Energy Secretary pick Jennifer Granholm essentially issued an “adapt or die” ultimatum to the oil sector. “The bottom line is this particular growth of clean energy and reduction of carbon provides a huge opportunity and I’m extending a hand of partnership,” she said at IHS Markit’s annual CERAWeek conference.  The United States has been seriously dragging its feet when it comes to the global clean energy race. While the country has continued to focus on shale oil and gas, the resource that launched it to the top of the global energy food chain, other countries have been building up robust clean energy infrastructure and setting up assertive policies to develop infrastructure and production capacity that positions them at the forefront of an inevitable sea change in the way we source our energy.  This reticence on the part of the United States has put the country in a, particularly vulnerable position when it comes to the energy independence that the nation has enjoyed for so long, and which is no longer such a sure thing. While the U.S. has been able to dominate shale oil and gas markets thanks to the shale revolution of the past decades, renewables have leveled the playing field, and there is now major competition from China and Europe. The country’s aging infrastructure and practically prehistoric power grids have left the nation poorly situated for adopting cleaner energy practices as well as for ramping up domestic production, not to mention leaving the U.S. energy system vulnerable to security risks and cyberattacks. 
  Related: The 3 Nations Vying For Global LNG Dominance Texas oil, however, will not go easy into that goodnight. Texas lawmakers are bracing for a fight, pulling out all of the policy stops to make decarbonization efforts as difficult in the Lone Star State. “Unfortunately, our economic bedrock of oil and gas is under attack by an administration that is bent on eliminating millions of jobs,” Republican Congressman Brian Babin told the public back in February at a press event along with six other Texan lawmakers, as he spoke in front of the refineries and petrochemical plants of the Houston Ship Channel.  Republican lawmakers have indeed circled the wagons, pushing Senate Bill 13, which would require state entities to divest from any companies that are themselves divesting from fossil fuels. Another bill currently working its way through the Texas docket is House Bill 17, which would bar Texas municipalities from banning natural gas as a fuel source in newly constructed residences, subdivisions, and other developments. 
 But not everyone in the private sector, even those in the oil and gas industry, is in agreement with this ideological petro-protectionism. Those who are following the money can see that the economic future does not lie in oil and gas, no matter what laws are on the books in Texas. “Imagine what it would be like to try to get a big new hydrogen pipeline built between New York City and Boston. It would be impossible. We have a lot of incumbent advantages here,” Tudor told the Financial Times. “One thing Houstonians and Texans, in general, are pretty good at is seeing a commercial opportunity for the grabbing and we do think there are really good commercial opportunities associated with the energy transition.”   And there are already plenty of ventures trying to make Texas the new clean energy hub of the United States. They’re highly outnumbered, but they’re growing, and Houston could soon see itself at the helm of wind, solar, and energy storage in the U.S. if more Texans can get on board with letting go of oil and gas.",Positive
America Looks For A Balance Between Oil Needs And Climate Reality.html,"It’s an eternal dispute - the need to meet consumer energy needs through oil and gas production versus the battle of climate change activists and green policy.  When President Biden came into office in January his stance on green policy was in stark contrast with his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden promises a Green New Deal under which he will pave the way for the banning of oil and gas drilling on public lands, protect a third of America’s land and ocean, introduce a government electric vehicle (EV) fleet, and move away from traditional fuel towards EV for the mail and military. Biden immediately re-joined the Paris Agreement in an effort to show the country and the world that he meant business, thereby leaving America’s oil and gas industry in a state of uncertainty about the future of the country’s black gold.  Earlier this year, Biden imposed a temporary ban on new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters, while the Interior Department carried out a “comprehensive review” of the leasing program. The idea was to reconsider the industry’s impact on the environment and global warming.  This lease ban was overturned by a federal judge in June after 13 states filed a legal challenge in Louisiana to end it. This means many jobs remain safe and production levels can resume, but at what cost to the environment?   Related: The Next Major Wildcard For Oil There’s no getting away from it, America runs on oil. Fuelling the nation, forming a major part of its export economy, and providing thousands of jobs across the country, the ongoing need for the oil industry in the U.S. is evident. 
 And despite the show from Biden to make America green, he continues to invest in the country’s oil industry, knowing that it is still needed to maintain stability until an alternative is viable.  To this end, early in 2021 he approved the new Willow project by ConocoPhillips’ in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A), as well as arguing against the shutting down of the Dakota Access pipeline that carries around half-million bpd of oil between South Dakota and Illinois.  In addition, Big Oil holds all the cards thanks to the ongoing lucrative business of fuelling the world. Oil supermajors such as Royal Dutch Shell have long been donating to political lobby groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, to stall and weaken legislation threatening big oil’s position of power in America. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP, all make similar contributions to ensure their place in the U.S.  However, with plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, while oil is very much set to stay in the U.S. over the next decade, many companies are looking to modernize, increase their renewable energy portfolios, and cut carbon in line with international expectations. This comes following months of pressure from the government and the International Energy Agency (IEA).  “The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable, and the cost of inaction keeps mounting,” Biden stated on Earth Day. “The countries that take decisive actions now will be the ones that reap the clean-energy benefits of the boom that’s coming.”
  Related: Oil Prices Crash After OPEC+ Reaches Deal To Ease Cuts Little is happening to slow production, as companies fight to produce as much as possible before demand wanes later this decade, however companies are looking to improve environmental policies through new technologies such as carbon capture and storage and wastewater recycling for use in other industries. The IEA strongly supports the introduction of CCS programs, believing they add “significant strategic value” in the transition to net-zero. Samantha McCulloch, head of CCUS technology at the IEA, stated “CCUS is a really important part of this portfolio of technologies that we consider.”  So, while the fight against climate change continues and pressure is being put on governments to introduce a green policy that would significantly hinder oil and gas production, the more likely expectation is for oil and gas to stay in place while global demand remains high, changing practices to meet international expectations and new carbon emissions norms. ",Negative
China Buys Less Saudi Crude As It Slams The Brakes On Oil Imports.html,"Saudi Arabia remained China’s single largest crude oil supplier in June, ahead of Russia, although Saudi shipments to the world’s top oil importer fell by 19 percent last month amid lower overall imports, according to official Chinese customs data cited by Reuters. In June 2021, China imported 1.75 million barrels per day (bpd) of Saudi crude oil, China’s General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday. This volume was higher than the 1.62 million bpd crude oil imports from Russia, keeping the Kingdom ahead of Russia as China’s top oil supplier for an eight month running, according to the data quoted by Reuters. The customs data in China showed local refiners didn’t import any crude from either Iran or Venezuela, the two OPEC members under U.S. sanctions that restrict their oil exports.
 Unofficially, however, China continues to import oil from Iran, often disguised as coming from other countries, including from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to previous Reuters reports.  China has put the brakes on overall crude oil imports in recent months, due to rising oil prices and a government crackdown on operations of some independent refiners.
 China’s crude oil imports fell to around 9.77 million bpd in June, down by 2 percent on May and the lowest monthly level since the start of the year, customs data cited by Reuters showed last week.

10 Things You Never Knew About Oil.html,"From OPEC to U.S. shale, from fracking to negative oil prices, from endless political debates to inventories, the fossil fuel industry is never short on headlines. But the industry has a few lesser-known tidbits that might come as a surprise to even the savviest oil industry connoisseur.  In no particular order, here is our top 10 list of things you never knew about oil. Number 10 on our list was not inspired by DC Comics, although it’s easy to see why one would think so. Superhero fans might be surprised--and perhaps giddy--to learn that there is a Batman refinery. It gets its name not from the DC comics, but because of its location in Batman, Turkey. Batman in Turkish means “sunken”, and the town was named that because it often floods. If you’re disappointed that the refinery is not really named after the Caped Crusader, you are not alone.  Number 9 If you are an oil industry aficionado, you probably already knew that Venezuela is home to the biggest oil reserves of any country. But did you know that the Latin American country’s 304 billion barrels of oil are enough to supply the entire world with oil for 8.5 years? That’s over 18 quintillion liters of oil and enough to fill up the Baltic Sea more than two times over! Number 8 China might be scouring the rest of the world for oil as its own resources are tricky to get to, but China has been in the oil-search game for more than a millennium. The first known wells ever were drilled in China. In 347 AD, oil wells in China were drilled using bamboo poles. Some of those wells were nearly 800 feet deep!
  Number 7 Your grandparents might remember a time when Standard Oil was… well… the standard. But in 1911, Standard Oil was broken up into many different companies over antitrust issues. It was a fairly big development that changed the oil business in the United States forever. But did you know that many of those companies have since merged among themselves? Almost all of the split-off companies are today part of either Chevron, Exxon, BP, and Marathon.  Number 6 Alright, inventory watchers, wrap your head around this one. According to the Energy Information Administration, each 42-gallon barrel of crude oil actually yields 45 gallons of petroleum products due to something called “processing gain”. The EIA likens this phenomenon to popcorn, which gets bigger when you pop it. Number 5 Oil and gas have thousands of uses other than transportation and energy. There are about 6,000 different products that are made with oil and gas. Raingear, Kevlar, and Velcro are just a few of the things made with oil and gas. But without oil, you also wouldn’t have toilet seats or shower curtains. You also wouldn’t have antihistamines, which would make the world a pretty miserable place. Soap, aspirin, hearing aids, contact lenses, and hair color are just a few more products that rely on oil and gas.  Related: The Next Major Wildcard For Oil
 Number 4  OPEC--it drives world oil prices by restricting supply. It produces nearly 40% of the world’s oil. And whether you refer to them as an oil cartel or merely as a group, or snicker at OPEC’s cautious refusal to talk in terms of oil prices when we know that’s what they’re doing, OPEC undeniably plays a pivotal role in manipulating the oil markets on a global scale. Still, it may be shocking to consider just how much of the world’s oil OPEC members have found. Of the 20 largest oilfields in the history of the world, OPEC members are responsible for 14 of them. Of the world’s top 5 largest oilfields, all are in the hands of OPEC members, from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait, from Iran to Venezuela. The only country that has one of the top 10 oilfields in terms of barrels of oil equivalent that is NOT part of OPEC is Kazakhstan. Number 3 Despite the common measurement in barrels, no one ships oil in physical barrels. Why then, is oil referred to in terms of barrels? And why are there 42 gallons in a barrel instead of a nice round number like 40, or even 50? Measuring oil in terms of barrels comes from the United States. In Pennsylvania in the 1800s, oil was stored in whatever was handy--like jars. But as the industry began to take off, the industry needed something bigger to cart the oil around in for sale. People settled on the barrel merely because, at the time, whisky was stored in barrels. And, well, why reinvent the wheel? The barrel seemed like a perfect fit for the oil industry, too. As for why the seemingly random 42-gallon volume, sellers would base the sale off of 40 gallons and add an extra two gallons in for good measure to compensate for what surely would spill during transit.   Number 2 A fair amount of the oil floating around in the ocean got there honestly, by a natural phenomenon known as oil seeps. No one wants oil companies leaking or spilling oil into the ocean, but according to a 2003 report from the National Research Council, 160,000 tonnes are leaked into North American waters each year through these seeps. The area most susceptible happens to be eco-friendly California, where seeps leak 5 million gallons of oil into the ocean each year. Some slicks caused by these seeps are even visible via satellite and can form miles-long lines of oil. Number 1 The U.S. states of Texas and North Dakota, combined, produce more crude oil than any other country on the planet except the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. If Texas were a country, it would be the world’s 4th largest oil producer, excluding the United States. In 2020, Texas singlehandedly produced an average of 4.869 million bpd--more crude oil than every country except Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada. China (and of course the United States).",Positive
Whats Next For Oil After The New OPEC Deal.html,"The recent OPEC+ meeting ended with an agreement that would gradually increase the cartel’s monthly production until in late 2022 all of the 9.7 mm BOPD that had originally been withheld from the market, was restored. There was already an agreement in place through December of 2021, but the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s, (KSA) desire to extend it to the end of next year was a bone of contention with the United Arab Emirates, (UAE). This agreement was not reached easily and required some negotiation and compromise to achieve.  It has been widely reported that the crux of the disagreement between KSA and the UAE, was the latter’s desire for a higher output ceiling from which its share of curtailment would be calculated. This, while certainly true, is not the only factor in the new assertiveness demonstrated by the UAE in OPEC affairs.  There is a dichotomy of perspective about the peak for oil that has developed between the KSA and the UAE. The Saudis’ five year plan to diversify their revenues away from oil has not been as successful as initially hoped, and they now view oil production as underpinning their economy for decades to come. They also view the transition to renewables as having a multi-decade arc that will keep demand for oil and derivatives relatively high over this period. The new, higher price regime in or near the $70’s is a breath of fresh air for their economy. The UAE have had more success in attracting foreign investment, and on a parallel track, have energized their oil sector with a $122 bn investment plan, to dramatically increase production in the near term. Their view on the energy transition is that it will have a much shorter arc that could lead to substantial reserves being “stranded.” A very undesirable outcome for this tiny middle-Eastern nation, and makes them want to up production regardless of the impact on prices. This the underlying fear behind their insistence on a higher baseline for allocating their share of OPEC+ production. This led to the impasse that resulted in the first meeting ending abruptly with no statement forthcoming, as per usual.  This divergence in viewpoint has caused the UAE to purposefully step out of the shadow of the Saudi’s in discusses revolving around output. As we will learn, there was considerably more involved between these two key OPEC members than just raising the output levels. In this article we will take a deeper look at the regional tug of war that has developed for shaping the cartel’s destiny. A tug of war that has global implications on oil availability and price. First we will take a quick look at these competing philosophies as regards peak oil. The Saudi Vision 2030 plan The Saudi Vision 2030 plan was rolled out in 2016, with considerable fanfare when Mohammed bin Salman, (MBS) was named Crown Prince, becoming the defacto heir to the throne. The 2030 plan included a series of mega-projects including a futuristic city called Neom, that was intended to dramatically lessen the kingdom’s reliance on oil exports for revenue by 2030. This year, the five-year point since its implementation, the 2030 plan has under-performed its billing with less than half the planned revenue forecast from non-oil sources being achieved. Masked in the details is the fact that much of the actual increase has come from new taxes and not new outside investment, as noted in the linked article. Some of this may be associated with some missteps by the Crown Prince along the way. The Kashoggi killing, the privatization of Aramco failing to draw much external interest, a $200 bn solar farm that failed to draw enough support to get off the drawing board, and an attempt to launch a nuclear power project have all contributed to a sense of a lack of direction in the investment community.  With many internal problems associated with a young population that lacks preparation for modern employment, an economy that shrank 3% from the impact of the pandemic, and weaker growth internally from high taxes and subsidy cuts, KSA has struggled to balance its books. With external cash inflow insufficient to meet its economic needs the Kingdom has renewed its commitment to a heavier reliance on oil for longer into the future than it thought would be necessary just a few years ago. An energy consultant located in Dubai was quoted in the linked article as saying- “In the past five years, Saudi Arabia has made little progress in alleviating its reliance on oil-export revenues. It is probably going to take over 30 years to move away from oil dependency.” The UAE 5-year plan by contrast The UAE’s plan doesn’t have an iconic name as does KSA’s, but the country has met with more success on a number fronts on a relative basis. Its privatization of certain aspects of ADNOC properties, selling stakes in ADNOC subsidiaries drew $25 bn of foreign capital into the country without the trauma of actually going through an IPO process for the holding company. Something that was painful for the Kingdom. The UAE is now producing power from a 400+ MW plant in Dubai, and even in the nuclear power area the Emirates have outstripped their larger neighbor with a nuclear generating plant that’s come online just this year.
  Related: Everything You Need To Know About OPEC’s New Agreement The UAE has even gone a step further and successfully introduced a new futures contract on their production, known as the Murban. This is meant to facilitate their trading and optimize pricing and volumes within the production limits set by OPEC. The Emirates are also looking to move higher in the petroleum value chain with a $45 bn expansion of the Ruwais industrial complex. In this effort the country’s refining capacity will be doubled and a huge petrochemical complex will be built. Euro major oil companies, BP, (NYSE:BP), TotalEnergies, NYSE: TTE), and ENI, NYSE:E) are partners in this enterprise, and hold Production Sharing Agreements-PSA’s, for upstream development in the country. The major piece of this initiative was not launched until November of last year when it was announced that the country would begin a $122 bn expansion of ADNOC’s oil output with a goal of raising production to 5 mm BOPD. Which brings us back to the current state of affairs and competing philosophies regarding how best to extract the maximum value from their petroleum reserves. But, first let’s look at some of the regional power struggles that contribute to the tension between the two countries. Behind the scenes The Middle East seems an eternal hotbed of conflict of one type or another. Many factors play into this and we will focus on the competition for ascendancy in the region between KSA and the UAE. The Saudi/Iran proxy war in Yemen has been in and out of the news in recent years, but it drags on year after year. A key supporter of KSA in the effort to subdue the Houthi rebels has been the UAE. In 2019 it announced it would withdraw its troops from the conflict. A blow to Saudis attempt to call the war effort a regional coalition.  The easing of tensions between the UAE and Israel in a U.S. brokered peace deal have deepened the mistrust between these two states as well. Saudi remains deeply divided about Israel because of the Palestinian question, and looks to regional neighbors for support for their cause. Then in another regional power shift, KSA buried the hatchet with Qatar leaving the UAE out in the cold, and forced go along. The two countries for years had engaged a blockade of Qatar, until a U.S. brokered peace agreement led to a truce early this year in the last administration. With the regional back and forth taking place on other fronts, it was clear that the UAE had to at least “rattle the cage” of OPEC+ to protect its interests. What will the impact be on oil supplies? From the announcement that came out of Sunday’s meeting, it appears that the UAE got most of what they were seeking in terms of increasing their production baseline. Other countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait, and Iraq also saw their baseline quotas raised, so this was a shared victory. With the production management agreement extended through December of 2022, Saudi also got a key win for their concerns about too much oil driving prices down. On the horizon also is the potential return of about 1.5 mm BOPD from Iran once sanctions are lifted. The statement included language about the cartel reviewing this policy in the event this crude lands in the market.
 Prices for many grades of crude fell on the announcement of 400K barrels being returned to the market, with August contract for WTI dipping below $70 in Monday’s futures for the first time since early June. As I noted in an earlier OilPrice article when this outcome for OPEC+ was on the horizon, the global market can easily absorb this crude, assuming the recovery from Covid-19 continues. I think it will. The EIA projects that U.S. YE 2022 production will be ~12.2 mm BOPD. This breaks down to 1.8 mm BOPD from the GoM, and ~400K BOPD from Alaska, thus requiring shale production at ~10 mm BOPD. A boost of 2.2 mm BOPD from today’s rate of ~7.8 mm BOPD, and taking it far beyond the highest level ever produced in the shale patch.   I think expecting this variable to perform at the EIA’s assumed level is unrealistic. This agency has some rather simplistic assumptions used in making these estimates that mainly are backward looking and assigning rig numbers with crude production. This doesn’t take into account the fact that DUC-Drilled but UnCompleted wells withdrawal have been largely responsible for controlling the rate of decline this year in the face of reduced activity from prior years. In March of 2020, shale production peaked at 9.3 mm BOPD on the strength of a peak 1,100 Rigs in the prior 15 months, and 420 active frac spreads.  Data-EIA/PrimaryVision As we know the service and supply industry has been turned on its head the last three years, and is much smaller in terms of deployable rigs and pumps. Personnel have also been eliminated at a rate never before seen in an industry known for wide swings in activity. In our view these reductions along with the stated intent by the industry to repair balance sheets and reward investors with stock buybacks and improved dividend payouts, augurs against a return to 2019 in terms of activity. The next variable is the rapid spread of the “Delta” Covid variant. This, in my view, is more a matter of perception than a sea change in the general direction of the recovery. While more transmissible than the original strain, it seems to result in a milder infection, and the vaccines are near 97% effective in preventing infection. And, of course the good news that seldom gets reported is the infection itself in the unvaccinated will eventually bring about the “herd” immunity among the population that will render Covid to essentially the same status as the flu. Some you live with and doesn’t cause a wide spread panic. Your takeaway The upshot of all of these factors-the OPEC+ agreement, production rates and North American shale activity levels, is that despite fluctuations due to market driven changes in sentiment, the price trend for oil will be higher. These changes in sentiment will be transitory in my view, creating opportunities to add to positions in key companies likely to benefit from these higher prices. Companies like Halliburton, (NYSE: HAL), Schlumberger, NYSE:SLB), Devon Energy, (NYSE: DVN), Occidental, (NYSE: OXY), ConocoPhillips, (NYSE:COP), Pioneer Exploration, (NYSE:PXD) are poised to report a resoundingly improved QoQ performance from Q-1, that will drive their stock prices higher. Investors who believe that the economic recovery that began last year with the announcement of the effectiveness of the vaccines, will continue should view the current ~20% average sell-off in the last couple of weeks as a buying opportunity.",Positive
Chinas Changing Policies Could Create A Huge Oil Demand Deficit.html,"Figures released last week show that China’s crude oil imports in the first half of 2021 declined for the first time in eight years. China has been the world’s largest net importer of crude oil and other liquids in the world since September 2013 and almost on its own created the 2000-2014 commodities ‘supercycle’, characterized by consistently rising price trends for all commodities – including oil - that are used in a booming manufacturing and infrastructure environment. This oil consumption boom from China was a product largely of the 8+ percent average annual GDP growth recorded by the country over that period, with many spikes well above 10 percent. So does this sudden dip in oil imports in the first half of this year – against declining economic growth over the past few years - mean that a major supportive driver of oil prices has gone for good? A noticeable decline in the rate of economic growth in China began in 2012 when it dipped below the key 8 percent figure for the first time since 1990. Since then the true number for China’s GDP growth has been a matter of considerable conjecture as, although the official annual figures have always been above at least 6 percent, traders and analysts are aware that the numbers are subject to extreme political pressures that could not tolerate headline GDP figures of, say, just 3 percent per year, where a number of traders and analysts think it is. Whatever the real figure, the fact remains that up until this latest data release for the first half of this year, China has still accounted for the consumption of 10-14 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil since 2012, crossing the 10 million bpd of crude oil imports level in 2019, having overtaken the U.S. as the world’s biggest net importer of crude oil in 2017.  China had also seemingly dealt with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic that peaked (to date) in 2020. By just the second week of April 2020 (only three to four months after the virus began to notably surface elsewhere in the world, and just a week or two after the first U.K. full national lockdown was announced) the lockdown of Wuhan - the Chinese city in which the global COVID-19 pandemic began – was eased. Although as an export-led economy, China would still face some trouble in the coming weeks and months, moves were immediately afoot to mitigate these downside risks to its economy.   In fact, even before the easing of the lockdown in Wuhan, China’s industrial sector had been back operating at levels above the pre-COVID-19 rates for over two weeks. According to data released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics at the beginning of April 2020, the official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) – a survey of sentiment among factory owners in the world’s second-largest economy – was 52 in March. Not only was this a huge leap up from the all-time low reading of 35.7 in February but also a reading of above 50 shows that the manufacturing sector was actually growing.
 Technically, it can be argued that the unexpected decrease in China’s crude oil imports in the first half of 2021 is a product of the decrease in margins available to China’s refiners given the recent rise in global crude oil prices. However, this also happened - and to a much greater degree - in the second half of 2018 and China’s crude oil imports did not dip then.  This time around it is critical to note that China’s Q2 GDP fell to 7.9 percent year-on-year (y-o-y), slightly lower than the 8.0 percent median forecasts of analysts covering the sector. “Aside from the fading favorable base effects, quarterly gains of 1.3 percent quarter-on-quarter [q-o-q] were on the back of downward revisions in the Q1 print,” SEB’s Singapore-based head of Asia strategy, Eugenia Victorino, told OilPrice.com last week. “While the June activity indicators managed to beat low expectations, momentum in growth remains imbalanced, with growth in retail sales easing to 12.1 percent y-o-y from 12.4 percent in May but the compound growth rate in the last two years eased to 4.9 percent in June from 8.0 percent in 2019, indicating that household spending remains far from pre-pandemic trends,” she said.  Related: Oil Continues To Collapse On OPEC News, COVID Fears “Meanwhile, residential property sales are quickly losing steam due to the rising mortgage rates and thus we are cautious of the stalling recovery in private consumption,” she added. “Additionally, the credit impulse has declined sharply in the last quarter and, historically, the credit cycle has a six-month lead, indicating a continued decline in sequential growth in the near term,” she underlined. “The broad-based reduction in the reserve requirement ratio that came into effect on 15 July should provide some offset to the easing growth momentum but whether this is enough to prolong the recovery is not yet clear,” she concluded.  The situation in which China finds itself may underpin the view that the country is no longer interested in playing the sort of leading role in the economy of the globe as it has done for the past 10-20 years in particular, which is even more concerning for those with a bullish take on future oil prices. “There was a time when China’s credit impulse was the most important piece of data in global macro and, for almost a decade, the country has been locked in a stop-go policy pattern, with every oscillation in China’s domestic monetary/fiscal stance eventually producing powerful swings in the broader global industrial cycle,” Dario Perkins, managing director of global macro for TS Lombard, in London, told OilPrice.com last week. “To be precise, if China tightened, the world could expect a deflation scare, typically around eight to ten months later and if the authorities eased then reflation would become the big theme,” he said. 
 This enduring correlation between China’s economic measures and the rest of the world seemed to go far beyond traditional trade links, including China’s role as a source of final demand, which, thinks Perkins, was – and has remained – a function of the fact that with the developed economies suffering secular stagnation and central banks powerless to stimulate demand, China had become the world’s main source of ‘balance sheet’. “By adding 30 percent of world GDP to the Chinese Communist Party balance sheet, the country had become the marginal source of demand for the entire global economy but this leaves a problem – because China no longer wants to play this role,” added Perkins.  More specifically, he underlined, Beijing has adjusted its economic objectives and is now less willing to engage in big credit stimulus, with the central Chinese authorities now cognizant of the fact that continued rapid debt build-up poses a risk to future growth and to social stability and national security as well. This ties into moves seen since 2017 in China that have broadly signaled a shift from credit-fuelled expansion to an emphasis on slower sustainable development, and have included a crackdown on shadow banking, tackling legacy debt burdens, and removing explicit GDP targets. This shift can also be seen in China’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to its response to the first significant onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. According to figures from TS Lombard, in 2020 China’s COVID-19 stimulus was 10 percent of GDP (versus 13 percent in 2008), compared to 26 percent of GDP in the U.S., 40 percent in Germany, and 24 percent in France. “China’s stop-go policy cycle is still there, but the threshold for intervention is higher and the scale of stimulus is likely to be smaller,” said Perkins.  So, what does this mean for global growth and, by extension, for oil demand? “Short-term, the world’s economic ‘cycle’ - if you can even call it that - is dominated by COVID, with the contractions and expansions associated with lockdowns and reopening comfortably dwarfing any spillovers from Chinese policy, either direct or indirect,” he underlined. But after the developed world has settled into a new normal in which COVID-19 or whatever subsequent variant comes along is dealt with and regarded in a similar manner to influenza – yearly mass vaccinations and the acceptance of a certain death rate per year -  then China’s shift in policy will leave a huge gap in global demand for oil (and all other commodities that are used in a booming manufacturing and infrastructure environment that Beijing has been buying up over the past 30 years). “If China is truly falling out of love with State stimulus then the world is going to need an alternative source of demand if it is going to avoid an even more stagnant economy than before COVID-19,” Perkins concluded. ",Positive
Europe Ramps Up Pivot Away From Fossil Fuels.html,"Reducing carbon emissions seems to be on the top of everybody’s agenda at the moment. A recent post in The New York Times reports on proposals being discussed in the European Union to drive the region’s pivot away from fossil fuels over the next nine years. According to the report, the most radical and possibly contentious proposal would impose tariffs on certain imports from countries with less-stringent climate protection rules. The proposals would also include eliminating the sales of new petrol- and diesel-powered cars in just 14 years. They also call for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). According to The New York Times, at the heart of the European road map is increased prices for carbon. Nearly every sector of the economy would have to pay a price for the emissions it produces. In turn, that would affect things like cement in construction and fuel for cruise ships. Proposed tariffs on imports of goods made outside the European Union, in countries with less-stringent climate policies, could invite disputes at the World Trade Organization. The cross-border carbon tax proposal could have the greatest impact on goods from Russia and Turkey, mainly iron, steel and aluminum. We covered that topic recently following howls of protest by European steel and aluminum producers that overseas supplier could simply direct low-carbon production to Europe and sell their higher-carbon content production elsewhere. That would leave a net-zero reduction in global carbon emissions. Furthermore, it would damage European manufacturers’ home markets by allowing in low-tariff imports from producers they deem to be cheating the system. The good news for U.S. exports to Europe is any impact would be far smaller.
 Little in the way of raw material is shipped from the U.S. to the E.U. Anyway, Democrats are looking at a similar tax, termed the “polluters tax” intended to have a similar impact. The proposals, if passed, would see the last gasoline or diesel cars sold in the European Union by 2035. According to the post, they would require that 38.5% of all energy be from renewables by 2030. The proposals also call for a significant increase in the price charged for carbon emitted to make the use of fossil fuels increasingly expensive. China is the world’s largest polluter. However, it faces some unique challenges. Its power generation industry is one of the youngest among major economies, with numerous new power stations coming onstream every month. To switch from that overwhelmingly coal-based capacity would entail eye-watering capital losses. Ahead of the upcoming Glasgow-hosted COP-26 climate talks later this year, China has just announced it will launch its long-awaited carbon market. According to The New York Times, it would be the world’s largest by volume of emissions. As with all carbon markets, though, its efficacy will in part be down to how generous Beijing’s get- out-of-jail-free cards it issues to polluters in the form of carbon credits. Nonetheless, it would be a start. Politically, this has some way to go.
 It is estimated it will take two years for the European Union’s policies to be debated, negotiated and finally agreed across the E.U.’s 27 national governments and with Brussels. Views differ widely as to priorities. Some countries, like Denmark, are already well on the way in the process of a huge switch to renewables. Others, like Poland and Germany, still rely heavily on coal for power generation. Hence, their industrial base would face substantial implications — unless carbon credits were so generous they would make the proposals meaningless. Related: The Ongoing Transformation Of ‘Big Oil’ Someone has to pay for such a colossal shift. It is always, in the end, the consumer. Politicians at the local level are well aware of this and will to varying degrees look to push the consequences as far into the future as possible — if not for when they are no longer in power then at least when they are in different ministerial roles. Then, it’s someone else’s problem. All the same, the flow of history is clear. Where governments fail, the market may well lead. Many firms, from automakers to electronics, are already seeing marketing opportunities in zero-carbon products. Those firms are shifting supply chains to be able to deliver that claim to market. Politicians’ rhetoric on the issue is widely supported by the majority of the public (at least in Europe). But that may change as the costs begin to bite.",Positive
Chinas Opaque Oil Data Leaves Markets In The Dark.html,"China saw its first-half crude imports drop year over year for the first time in a first half in eight years, sparking concerns in the market that purchases from the world’s largest oil importer may not be too supportive for oil in the coming months.  At the same time, Chinese fuel exports have been rising this past half-year due to record refinery run rates amid a glut of refined oil products.  In recent months, Chinese refiners have been processing more crude than the apparent availability, calculated as the sum of imports and domestic production, estimates by Reuters columnist Clyde Russell based on Chinese data show.  On the face of it, based on a simplified crude availability/product exports estimate, it would appear that China is consuming domestically less crude oil than before, according to Russell.  Analysts, who are watching closely the imports and estimated consumption trends in the world’s largest crude oil importer, are looking for clues about Chinese demand and purchases, which could, at times, be the single largest driver of oil prices.  Since China doesn’t report crude inventories in either commercial or strategic petroleum reserves, the analysts’ job is a complicated one and involves a lot of assumptions and ‘what ifs’.  Despite the uncertainty about how much crude oil China really consumes these days, one thing is clear: recent customs data out of China is giving the market some mixed signals, possibly tilted to the bearish side.  
  Related: Oil Stabilizes After Saudi-UAE Compromise Removes Major Uncertainty But there are two key reasons why Chinese crude oil imports fell in the first half for the first time since 2013. These are the significantly higher crude prices this year, compared to the Q2 2020 lows, and a crackdown on illicit fuel trade and tax avoidance or tax evasion from the private refiners, commonly known as teapots.   China’s crude oil imports fell to some 9.77 million barrels per day (bpd) in June 2021, down 2 percent in May and the lowest monthly level since the start of the year, according to customs data cited by Reuters. Over the first half of the year, China imported 260.66 million tons of crude, or 10.51 million bpd per Reuters estimates. This was a 3 percent drop compared to the first half of 2020. The first-half figure was boosted by increased imports by independent refiners. Since the first quarter, however, Beijing has begun cracking down on the teapots, as production of fuels both at independent refiners and state-owned majors was rising faster than demand, undermining refining margins and creating a glut. In addition, China has been increasing the oversight on the refining industry in order to crack down on the illicit fuel trade, close loopholes that some companies have been using to avoid paying fuel consumption taxes, and curb the fuel oversupply, part of which is the result of tax avoidance or tax evasion. At the same time, Chinese refiners processed a record amount of crude oil in June, at 14.8 million bpd, up by 3.9 percent from May when run rates also broke records, statistics data showed. The average daily run rates for the first half of the year were even higher, at 15.13 million barrels—up by 10.7 percent from a year earlier, the data also showed. 
 The record run rates are higher than the implied availability of crude in China as calculated by imports plus domestic production, Reuters’ Russell notes.  This suggests that refiners have been drawing down from inventories in recent months. They may likely prefer tapping into the (unknown) crude inventories stockpiled at ultra-low prices last year than paying in excess of $70 per barrel for oil for more imports now.  Going forward, the Chinese imports could cool down further if refiners continue to tap inventories than boost crude purchases at $70-plus oil.  Independent refiners are expected to curb crude imports in the second half of 2021 after China slashed by 35 percent the import quotas for the teapots in the second batch of oil buying authorizations this year. The significantly lower quotas suggest that private Chinese refiners could import much lower volumes in the second half of the year compared to last year and to recent months.   China’s opaque crude inventory data leads to a lot of speculation about how much the world’s top oil importer has stocked up in inventories and how it would act on the market with prices now more than double the average Brent price of just below $30 a barrel during the second quarter of 2020.   ",Negative
Weak Fuel Demand Sends Indias Oil Imports To 9 Month Low.html,"Indian refiners imported in June 2021 the lowest volume of crude oil in nine months, as purchases slowed down in April and May when India imposed regional mobility restrictions to curb a resurgence in COVID cases, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting tanker data from trade sources. India is estimated to have imported around 3.9 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in June, which was down by 7 percent compared to the imports in May. The June 2021 imports were still higher than in the same month of 2020, when India—and most of the world—was on nationwide lockdown. 
 The June 2021 slump in crude oil imports at the world’s third-largest oil importer was not surprising, considering that April and May—the months in which refiners likely nominated oil cargoes for June—saw the peak of India’s COVID crisis, with grim records in daily new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. The federal government decided against a nationwide lockdown, fearing economic collapse. But the most populous cities and regions were placed under regional lockdowns and various forms of curfew, which dragged down demand for the road transportation fuels gasoline and diesel. Indian fuel demand plunged by 9.4 percent in April compared to March due to the COVID crisis. Fuel demand in India continued to slump in May, with gasoline sales down to a one-year low and diesel consumption dropping to the lowest in seven months in the first two weeks of May.  As a result, refiners reduced run rates and nominated less crude for arrival in June as inventories grew. For example, India’s top refiner, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), had reduced its capacity utilization to 84 percent in the middle of May, compared to 100 percent last November when demand was rebounding. 
 In June 2021, Iraq remained India’s top oil supplier, with Saudi Arabia second and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) up four places to take the third spot of India’s largest crude suppliers, the data obtained by Reuters showed. ",Negative
The Best 2 Stocks To Hold As Oil Prices Explode.html,"Crude oil was already having a banner year amid a faster-than-expected recovery from the pandemic. Now, with an OPEC compromise in place, there will be no oil price war, volatility will settle down, and oil could—once again—become Wall Street’s No. 1 commodity. In mid-June, the ratio of bullish to bearish bets on oil in New York stood at an impressive 23 to 1. This compares with a ratio of 6 to 1 at the beginning of the year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Surging demand is beyond the expectations of many at this point, and that’s prompted a very bullish run on oil futures. Last year, oil consumption dropped by a record 8.6 million barrels per day amid the pandemic lockdowns.

OPEC Sees Global Oil Demand Exceeding 100 Million Bpd In 2022.html,"World oil demand is expected to surpass the 100 million barrels per day (bpd) mark in the second half of 2022, thanks to solid economic growth and expectations of continued success in containing the pandemic, OPEC said on Thursday. Global economic growth is set to jump by 5.5 percent this year and another 4.1 percent next year, the cartel said in its closely-watched Monthly Oil Market Report released on Thursday. OPEC sees global oil demand growing by 6 million bpd this year, unchanged from last month’s assessment. Total oil demand is projected to average 96.6 million bpd in 2021.
 Next year, global oil demand will rise by a further 3.3 million bpd over 2021 to average 99.86 million bpd, roughly returning to the average demand of 2019, before the pandemic. The 100-million-bpd mark will be exceeded in the second half of 2022, OPEC said.  Oil demand in developed economies is set to rise by 1.5 million bpd in 2022 over 2021, with U.S. oil demand leading the increase, although American oil demand will be marginally below 2019 levels, mainly due to lagging transportation fuel demand. OECD Europe and Asia Pacific will also grow, but remain below 2019 levels. Led by China and India, oil demand in developing economies is projected to increase by 1.8 million bpd in 2022 and exceed pre-pandemic levels. This growth will be supported by the recovery in transportation fuels and firm industrial fuels demand, including petrochemical feedstocks. In terms of fuels, gasoline and diesel are expected to lead oil demand growth in 2022, OPEC said.
 Jet fuel will continue to recover, thanks to domestic and international air travel, but business travel is expected to lag. OPEC flagged a number of uncertainties in the 2022 outlook, including the pandemic-related impact on transportation fuels and acceleration of inflation in case of strong growth. ",Positive
Chinese Refineries Shatter Records In June.html,"China’s refineries processed a record amount of crude oil last month, at 14.8 million bpd, up by 3.9 percent from May when run rates also broke records, Reuters reported, citing data from the national statistics bureau. The average daily run rates for the first half of the year were even higher, at 15.13 million barrels—up by 10.7 percent from a year earlier, the data also showed. Refinery runs globally surged by as much as 1.6 million barrels per day in June, up from a stagnant performance in May, the International Energy Agency said in its Oil Market Report for July published earlier this week.
 After the June jump, which was the largest monthly increase since July 2020 as per Reuters estimates, refinery runs are expected to further jump through July and August. The increase over this month and next is expected at another 2.7 million bpd from June levels, the IEA said. China certainly accounted for a lot of that increase, but in the second half of the year, things may well change. A lot of the increase during the first half came from independent refiners, the so-called teapots, which just saw their second batch of import quotas reduced by Beijing as excess fuel supply has started eating into refiners’ margins and as the government tightens its grip on the independent refining industry. According to FGE analysts, as cited by Reuters, run rates at independent refineries could decline by close to half a million barrels daily in the current quarter because of the quota cuts and a crackdown on quota trading between state oil majors and teapots.
 Meanwhile, crude oil imports have been on the decline in the first half of the year, according to the latest customs data. It’s worth noting, however, that the decline was from unusually high import rates last year amid low oil prices that China used to fill up its inventories.",Negative
Kuwait Looks At Huge Wealth Fund To Move Beyond Oil.html,"Kuwait’s life-after-oil fund may have become one of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth funds thanks to the country’s healthy oil industry, as it continues to prepare for a life after oil as it invests heavily in the sector while it still can. The Future Generations Fund, managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority or KIA, is thought to be worth around $700 billion at present, according to sources in the country, after closing at $670 billion at the end of the fiscal year in March, making it the world’s largest oil fund after those of Norway and China.  The fund has steadily grown in recent years as Kuwait attempts to invest money earned from oil and gas to eventually decrease its dependency on the sector. Around half of its investments are based in the U.S., where Kuwait is seeing a significant return on its S&P 500 stocks and shares, following an uncertain year during the pandemic.  However, many have highlighted the need for Kuwait to diversify its economy beyond oil and gas for years, encouraging the country not to put all its eggs in one basket. A report from earlier this year suggested that the low global demand in 2020, driven by the pandemic, and this year’s OPEC+ cuts in production have reduced the income from Kuwaiti oil.  Because of its oil dependence, and other knock-on effects of the pandemic, Kuwait saw around an 8 percent decrease in its GDP in 2020. But the outlook is hopeful as the country is expecting its GDP to grow by 2.5 percent in 2020, owing to greater investment in its non-oil sector. 
 As oil demand recovery steadily improves, OPEC+ is expected to reduce cuts over the summer months to resume pre-pandemic production levels. In addition, Kuwait’s originally slow vaccine rollout is finally picking up pace, meaning restrictions are expected to ease so businesses can reopen. But the last year and a half of turbulence has taught Kuwait that it cannot depend solely on its oil sector forever.   Related: Colombia Looks Offshore To Revitalize Its Oil Industry Kuwait is not the only state in the Middle East to look for greater economic diversification as several Gulf states realised the importance of investing beyond oil during the 2014 oil price crash, although many were not prepared for this crash leading to the need for austerity policies.  Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have all relied heavily on oil and gas for the last half a century, building their economies on the foundation of energy. Now, several are looking at hydrogen and other renewable options as a means of modernising their already strong energy sectors in line with global demand for greener energy. 
 But Kuwait still has a long way to go, according to a Moody report, with heavy investment in oil and gas expected to continue throughout the 2020s. Moody suggests that little progress has been made since the 2014 crash, despite attempts at diversification, and oil dependence in the region will continue for at least the next decade. At present, oil and gas production in Gulf states continues to contribute around 20 percent to GDP, account for 65 percent of total exports and around 50 percent of state revenues.   Alexander Perjessy, VP and senior analyst at Moody explains, “The announced plans to boost hydrocarbon production capacity and government commitments to zero or very low taxes make it unlikely that heavy reliance on hydrocarbons will diminish significantly in the coming years.” So, while Kuwait’s oil wealth fund shows significant promise, the country and region have a long way to go before they can decrease their dependence on oil and gas, as Kuwait and most other Gulf states will continue to invest heavily in the industry so long as global demand remains. ",Positive
EIA Inventory Report Sends Oil Prices Higher.html,"Crude oil prices inched higher today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 7.9 million barrels for the week to July 9. The report was delayed due to a technical issue, per MarketWatch. Last week’s inventory decline compared with a draw of 6.9 million barrels for the previous week and an estimated decline of 4 million barrels, as reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday.
 At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $ 76.15 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate was trading at $74.79 a barrel, both down from opening as Saudi Arabia and UAE agreed on the extension of OPEC+ production cuts until end-2022, with UAE allowed to up production. In gasoline, the authority estimated a stock build of 1 million barrels for the week to July 9, which compared with significant draw of 6.1 million barrels reported for the previous week. Production of gasoline last week averaged 9.9 million bpd, which compared with 10.6 million bpd for the previous week. Gasoline demand has been on a strong rebound in the United States and this, coupled with tighter supply and logistical problems, has brought prices at the pump at the highest in months. The national average per gallon of gasoline was $3.12 per gallon as of July 12, per GasBuddy.
 In middle distillates, meanwhile, the EIA reported an inventory build of 3.7 million barrels for the week to July 9. This compared with an inventory build of 1.6 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production averaged 4.9 million bpd last week, compared with 5 million bpd for the previous week. Oil prices have been on the seesaw recently, as rising worry about the spread of the latest coronavirus variant—and reports of newly emerging ones—dampened optimism about the global economy somewhat.",Negative
